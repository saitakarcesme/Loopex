# Loopex / Akorith — agent guide

**Akorith** is the current repository, package, and visible product name; **Loopex** remains only as
a historical name and in the retained `loopex.db` / `loopex.config.json` filenames. Akorith was
introduced as the visible name in Phase 9.1. It is an Electron + TypeScript + React desktop workspace that orchestrates coding
agents **without any API keys**: the center planning chat talks to the user's own
Claude / ChatGPT subscriptions (via their installed CLIs) or a local Ollama server; the
selected CLIs run headlessly behind the conversation; the left sidebar holds projects and session
history. Built with electron-vite, in strict numbered phases — currently through Phase 74
(the Workspace turn-flow reset).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** and npm (Node 20+ works; developed on 22).
- **Windows 10 1809+** (ConPTY) and **macOS (Apple Silicon)** are both supported as of
  Phase 6 (see the spawn-helper note below). Linux is untested.
- For the chat providers (all optional — the app runs with any subset):
  - `claude` CLI installed and logged in (Claude provider; uses the user's subscription).
  - `codex` CLI installed and logged in (ChatGPT provider; uses the user's ChatGPT login).
  - Ollama running at `http://localhost:11434` with at least one pulled model (Local provider).
- No API keys anywhere, by design.

## Install & run

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev        # electron-vite dev server + Electron window
npm run typecheck  # tsc over main, preload, and renderer
```

Native modules — two different stories, both in `dependencies` (electron-vite's
`externalizeDepsPlugin` keeps them out of the bundle) and both main-process only:

- **node-pty 1.1.0** ships N-API prebuilds that load in Electron without any rebuild.
  Never rebuild it — compiling node-pty from the npm tarball fails (missing winpty git
  metadata, `GetCommitHash.bat`).
- **better-sqlite3** is ABI-specific (not N-API), so `postinstall` runs
  `electron-rebuild -f -o better-sqlite3` — for this module that's a prebuilt-binary
  download for Electron's ABI, not a compile, so clean installs work without VS Build
  Tools. `npm run rebuild` is the same command. The `-o` (only) flag matters: a bare
  rebuild would walk node-pty too and fail.
- **macOS spawn-helper fix (Phase 6).** node-pty's npm tarball ships its prebuilt
  `prebuilds/darwin-*/spawn-helper` companion binary with mode `0644` — no execute bit.
  On macOS node-pty `exec()`s that helper to launch the shell, so without `+x` *every*
  PTY spawn dies with `posix_spawnp failed` and both terminals fail to open. This hits
  every macOS user on a clean install, so `postinstall` chains `node
  scripts/fix-spawn-helper.js`, which on macOS only chmods `+x` each darwin spawn-helper
  it finds (idempotent, defensive about node-pty's layout, never fails the install,
  no-op on Windows/Linux). The shell-resolution logic in `pty.ts` was already
  cross-platform (`$SHELL`/zsh/bash on non-Windows) and was **not** the bug.

**Dev-server caveat:** `electron-vite dev` does NOT hot-rebuild `src/main` or
`src/preload`. After changing anything there, restart the dev server. Renderer code
hot-reloads normally.

## Architecture

- `src/main/` — Electron main process. `pty.ts` owns the PTY sessions (node-pty,
  PowerShell, ids `t1`/`t2`); `providers/` is the chat-provider system.
- `src/preload/` — the only bridge between renderer and main: a frozen, typed
  `window.api` (`pty` + `chat` namespaces) over validated IPC channels.
  contextIsolation and sandbox are ON; nodeIntegration is OFF. Keep it that way.
- `src/renderer/` — React UI. The chat panel renders whatever the provider registry
  reports; it never hardcodes a backend list.

### Provider system (Phase 3)

Every chat backend implements the `Provider` interface in
`src/main/providers/types.ts` (`id`, `label`, `kind`, `isAvailable()`, `listModels()`,
`send()` with streaming `onToken` and a `SendResult` whose `usage` object is a contract
later phases depend on). Providers are equal citizens: no provider file imports another.

The registry (`src/main/providers/registry.ts`) is the single source of truth for which
backends exist. It reads `loopex.config.json` from Electron's userData dir
(`%APPDATA%\letsgetit\loopex.config.json` on Windows), created on first run as:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "claude":  { "enabled": true },
    "chatgpt": { "enabled": true },
    "local":   { "enabled": true, "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434" }
  }
}
```

- Disable/remove an entry and the provider disappears from the UI — no code change.
- `models: [...]` overrides a provider's model list.
- An unavailable provider (CLI missing, not logged in, Ollama down) never crashes the
  app; it shows greyed-out in the UI with its reason.
- Config is re-read on every provider-list fetch — the ↻ button in the chat header picks
  up edits without restarting.

### Adding a new provider

1. Implement the `Provider` interface (see `types.ts`; `claude.ts` is the reference).
2. Either add it to the `BUILT_IN` map in `registry.ts` (one line, for in-tree
   providers), **or** drop a compiled `.js` file anywhere on disk exporting
   `createProvider(entry)` (or a default class) and reference it from config with no
   code change at all:

   ```json
   "my-provider": { "enabled": true, "module": "providers/my-provider.js" }
   ```

   Relative `module` paths resolve against the userData dir.
3. Populate `SendResult.usage` honestly: real numbers with `estimated: false` when the
   backend reports them, char-count approximations with `estimated: true` when it
   doesn't. Never fabricate costs.

### How each built-in provider works

- **claude** — `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose
  --include-partial-messages`, prompt over stdin; streams `text_delta`s; real token
  counts and `total_cost_usd` from the final `result` event.
- **chatgpt** — `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --output-last-message <tmpfile>`,
  prompt over stdin; the clean answer is read from the tmpfile; usage is estimated
  (`estimated: true`), cost never fabricated.
- **local** — Ollama HTTP API: `/api/tags` for models, `/api/chat` with `stream: true`;
  real `prompt_eval_count`/`eval_count`, `costUsd: 0`.

### Chat→terminal bridge (Phase 4)

The bridge sends chat-produced text into a terminal with one click — no copy-paste.
**There is exactly one injection path**: `bridgeSend({text, targetTerminalId, autoEnter})`
in `src/main/bridge.ts`, which calls `PtyManager.write()`. Never add a second way to
write programmatically to a PTY. The UI reaches it via the validated `bridge:send` IPC
channel (`window.api.bridge.send`); the Phase 9 macro-loop calls `bridgeSend()` directly
after user approval — design changes must keep it callable headlessly.

Three send modes in the chat panel, all funneling through that one function:

1. **Per code block** — each fenced code block in an assistant message renders with its
   own "→ Terminal" button sending exactly that block's content.
2. **Whole message** — a "→ Terminal" button in the message footer sends the **full
   message text** (deliberate choice: literal and predictable; the per-block buttons
   already cover the code-only case).
3. **Manual selection** — highlighting text in the chat area shows a floating
   "Send selection →" popover that sends just the highlighted text.

**Target terminal**: a single current target (`t1` = **Atlantis**, default, or `t2` =
**Olympus**), shown and changed via the segmented control in the bridge bar at the top
of the chat panel. Every send goes to the current target; it is never re-asked per send.

**Auto-Enter**: the bridge-bar toggle, persisted in `loopex.config.json` as
`"bridge": { "autoEnter": false }` (default OFF). OFF = text lands at the prompt and
waits for the user's own Enter; ON = a trailing `\r` is appended so the CLI executes
immediately. Multi-line text is wrapped in bracketed-paste markers
(`ESC[200~ … ESC[201~`, inner newlines normalized to `\r`) so interactive TUIs
(`claude`, `codex`) accept it as one paste without running lines early; note the plain
PowerShell 5.1 prompt does not support bracketed paste, so multi-line sends are
intended for the interactive CLIs. Dead-target sends return a clear error (surfaced as
a toast), never a silent drop.

### Persistence + dashboard (Phase 5)

SQLite database at `loopex.db` in the userData dir (co-located with
`loopex.config.json`), opened by `src/main/db.ts` (better-sqlite3, WAL,
foreign keys ON). All DB access is main-process; the renderer uses validated IPC only
(`history:*`, `usage:*`, `test:*`, `evaluate:*`). Core history/usage tables:

- `projects(id, name, path nullable, color nullable, icon nullable, created_at, updated_at)` —
  Phase 9.1 workspace folders. Paths are user-provided metadata and are only acted on by an
  explicit user button.
- `sessions(id, provider_id, title, project_id nullable, created_at, updated_at)` — **a session belongs to
  one provider**; switching provider in the chat starts a new session context. Phase 9.1 adds
  nullable `project_id` so new chats can be associated with the selected project without breaking
  old sessions.
- `messages(id, session_id FK CASCADE, role user|assistant, content, provider_id,
  model, created_at)`.
- `usage_events(id, ts, provider_id, model, prompt_tokens, completion_tokens,
  cache_read_tokens, cache_write_tokens, reasoning_tokens, total_tokens, cost_usd,
  estimated 0/1, request_count, session_id nullable FK, source_kind nullable,
  source_id nullable)` — Phase 70 extends the table additively. Normal Chat still writes exactly
  one row per assistant send from the `SendResult.usage` contract inside the `chat:send` handler.
  Each Research job writes one visible `research-request` row (`request_count=1`), while its
  plan/cycle/synthesis model calls write token-only rows (`request_count=0`). `total_tokens` is the
  canonical total when a provider supplies it; component sums are only a compatibility fallback.
  The optional source identity is unique when present, so retries and historical backfill are
  idempotent. Indexed on `ts` and `(provider_id, ts)`. The Phase 6 router and Dashboard read the
  unified ledger.

Phase-specific persistence also lives here:

- `test_runs(...)` — Phase 7 test-lab metrics. Phase 8 adds nullable
  `generated_files` JSON metadata for newly generated tests so reports and judges can
  include the generated code excerpt; old rows remain valid and use the retained sandbox
  path as a best-effort fallback.
- `evaluations(id, ts, kind single|comparison, test_run_ids JSON, judge_model nullable,
  dimension_scores JSON, weights JSON, total_score, rationale nullable, pdf_path nullable)` —
  one row per Evaluate action. `dimension_scores` stores every per-run dimension, the
  formulas used, active/effective weights, optional judge usage, and any judge-failure note.
- `macro_sessions(id, created_at, updated_at, status, goal, planner_provider,
  planner_model, target_terminal, max_iterations, good_enough_threshold, include_repo_digest,
  repo_digest_snapshot, final_score, stop_reason)` — one row per Phase 9 loop.
- `macro_turns(id, session_id FK CASCADE, turn_index, created_at, status, proposal,
  edited_proposal, sent_prompt, executor_result_summary, planner_rationale, expected_result,
  confidence_score, good_enough_score, risk_level, provider_used, model_used, error)` — one row
  per proposed/approved/skipped loop turn.

The sidebar shows the Akorith brand, icon nav, project folders, recent chats, one colored
folder per registry provider (plus orphaned providers that still have sessions), rename/delete/
new-chat, and a local profile/settings entry. Clicking a session restores its conversation into
the chat panel. Sidebar nav switches between **Workspace** (default, 3-pane), **Dashboard**, and
**Test**; the workspace stays mounted
(`display:none`) while the dashboard is open so the terminal PTYs are never disturbed.
The dashboard (recharts + a CSS-grid calendar heatmap) reads only `usage_events`, including
Research request/token rows: activity heatmap, per-day stacked token bars by provider,
provider-distribution donut, and summary cards. Providers with estimated counts render hatched
with an "≈" tag.

### Model router — SUGGEST ONLY (Phase 6)

`src/main/router.ts` proposes a provider/model for a prompt's difficulty and warns when
recorded subscription usage is high. It **never switches providers** — the renderer shows
the suggestion and the user Accepts (selectors switch for that send) or Ignores it. Every
send still goes through the unchanged `chat:send` path with the user's own selection.

- **Difficulty tiers** `Asker` / `Albay` / `General` (Soldier / Colonel / General):
  trivial-mechanical / moderate / hard-complex-large.
- **Classifier** runs **on demand** (the "✦ Suggest" button), never per keystroke. It
  calls a **local Ollama** model *directly* (`/api/chat`, `stream:false`, temp 0) — never
  through `chat:send` — so it **writes no `usage_event`** and burns no subscription tokens.
  Model = `router.classifierModel` (default: first installed Ollama model). With no local
  model it falls back to a rule-based heuristic (length/keywords/file-mentions/fences) and
  the suggestion is tagged `heuristic`.
- **tier→provider/model** is config-driven (`router.tierMap`, editable, never hardcoded in
  logic). Default `Asker→local`, `Albay→chatgpt`, `General→claude`. Only available
  providers (per the registry) are suggested; if the mapped one is unavailable the router
  **degrades** to the best available and says why.
- **Limit awareness — WARN ONLY.** It sums `usage_events` over a rolling window
  (`router.warnThresholds`: `windowHours`, `costUsd`, `events`, `tokens`) per provider.
  When a subscription provider is over threshold it shows a non-blocking warning — *"based
  on usage recorded in Akorith, not your official plan limit"* — and for Asker/Albay nudges
  (does not force) toward local. We cannot read official plan limits; this is Akorith's own
  recorded usage only. Fulfils the old `TODO(phase 6)` in `db.ts`/`registry.ts`.

Config keys (defaults filled in by `getRouterSettings()` so pre-Phase-6 config files still
work): `router.classifierModel`, `router.tierMap`, `router.warnThresholds`.

### Repo context digest — opt-in (Phase 6)

`src/main/digest.ts` builds a **bounded** read-only snapshot of the working repo. The chat
has an "Include repo context" toggle (default OFF, persisted in `digest.enabled`). When ON,
`chat:send` prepends the digest to what the **provider** sees — the stored user message and
the `usage_event` stay the clean typed prompt, and a digest failure never blocks the send.

The digest is `git diff --stat` + a capped `git diff` + `git log --oneline -n 10` + a
depth-limited file tree from `git ls-files` (tracked + untracked-not-ignored, so `.gitignore`
is respected). A **hard total cap** (`digest.maxTotalBytes`) governs everything; the heavy
full diff is included only if it fits, else a truncation note replaces it. A non-git dir
yields just a filesystem tree and a clear "not a git repository" note instead of an error.
It is prepended as a delimited `## Repo context` block labelled context, not instructions.
Config: `digest.enabled`, `digest.workingDir` (default the app cwd), `digest.maxDiffBytes`,
`digest.maxTotalBytes`, `digest.treeDepth`. The Phase 9 macro-loop reuses `buildDigest()`
directly when its "Include repo context" option is enabled.

### Macro-loop orchestration — semi-automatic planner/executor loop (Phase 9)

The Workspace chat panel includes a compact **Macro loop** area near the bridge controls.
Phase 9.1 polishes its presentation without changing the safety model. The user enters a
high-level goal, chooses a planner provider/model from the registry, picks target terminal
Atlantis/Olympus (`t1`/`t2` internally), sets max iterations and a
good-enough threshold, and chooses whether to include repo context. The loop is
semi-automatic only: every turn produces one proposed executor prompt, and the user must approve
or edit it before anything is sent to a terminal.

State machine statuses are explicit and persisted:

- `idle`
- `preparing_context`
- `proposing`
- `awaiting_approval`
- `sending`
- `awaiting_executor_result`
- `completed`
- `stopped`
- `error`

`src/main/macro.ts` owns the IPC/state transitions; `src/main/macro-core.ts` is the
Electron-free parser/prompt helper exercised by `scripts/verify-macro-loop.ts`.

**Planner calls are meta calls.** The macro-loop uses `sendMetaPrompt()` from the provider
registry, so proposals use the same provider implementations (Claude CLI, Codex CLI, Ollama, or
external providers) but write no chat messages and no `usage_event`. The dashboard remains
reserved for normal visible planner chat sends. If the selected provider is unavailable or the
call fails, the loop records an actionable error and leaves the persisted session recoverable.

**Planner prompt contract.** Each proposal asks the planner for strict JSON:
`next_prompt`, `rationale`, `expected_result`, `done_score`, `risk_level`, and
`requires_user_approval`. The prompt instructs the planner to produce one paste-ready executor
step, preserve Akorith security invariants, avoid unsafe architecture changes, prefer surgical
edits, and require the executor to report changed files, tests run, failures, and commit status.
If JSON parsing fails, the raw response becomes an editable proposal and is marked with an error
on the turn.

**Repo context reuse.** When enabled, the loop calls the existing `buildDigest()` and stores the
bounded snapshot on `macro_sessions.repo_digest_snapshot`; there is no second repo scanner.
If a Phase 9.1 project with a path is selected, the macro UI can point the existing digest
working directory at that project before creating the loop.

**Approval-gated executor send.** Approving a turn calls `bridgeSend()` in `src/main/bridge.ts`
with the selected terminal and persisted Auto-Enter setting. This preserves the single
programmatic write path: `bridgeSend()` → `PtyManager.write()`. The sent prompt is recorded on
`macro_turns.sent_prompt`.

**Awaiting executor result.** Phase 9 does not parse terminal output. After sending, the loop
enters `awaiting_executor_result` and waits for the user to paste or summarize the executor
report before continuing. The next proposal includes prior proposals, sent prompts, result
summaries, current iteration, and optional repo digest.

Stop conditions:

- Manual Stop aborts an in-flight planner call when possible and marks the session `stopped`.
- Max iterations stops after the user records a result for the last allowed turn.
- Good-enough threshold (`done_score >= good_enough_threshold`) is shown in the UI, but does not
  auto-send. The user can mark complete, continue anyway, or stop.
- Mark complete is available after proposals/results and sets status `completed`.

Known limitations for Phase 9:

- No fully automatic/autopilot mode yet.
- Terminal output is not auto-interpreted; the user pastes or summarizes executor results.
- The router remains suggest-only and is not allowed to auto-switch planner providers.
- Ollama may be absent; Local provider paths degrade through existing availability checks.

### Akorith UI + workspace projects (Phase 9.1)

Phase 9.1 starts the visible rename from **Loopex** to **Akorith**. The app window title,
top-left brand, renderer favicon/logo, terminal/product text, and PDF report branding now say
Akorith. The repository, package name, `loopex.config.json`, `loopex.db`, and native packaging
identifiers remain Phase 10 work.

UI direction: deep neutral gray base, lifted dark panels, muted purple accent, restrained success/
warning/error states, and subtle provider identity colors (Claude = clay, ChatGPT/Codex = muted
blue, Local/Ollama = muted purple). Motion is intentionally fast and small (about 120-220ms), and
the stylesheet respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Sidebar changes:

- Collapsible left sidebar, persisted in renderer `localStorage`.
- Icon nav for Workspace / Dashboard / Test.
- Colored provider groups, plus compact collapsed provider indicators.
- Recent chats section backed by existing SQLite sessions.
- Project folders backed by the `projects` table. Creating a new chat while a project is selected
  writes that project id to `sessions.project_id`; old chats remain valid with `NULL`.
- Phase 9.1.1 supersedes the earlier "move terminals to folder" action: selecting/opening a
  project with a valid path now restarts the execution panes in that cwd through the PTY lifecycle
  path instead of sending `cd` into already-running terminals.
- Local profile/settings entry stores a display name in renderer `localStorage`.

Workspace changes:

- User-facing terminal names are **Olympus** (`t2`, top) and **Atlantis** (`t1`, bottom). Internal
  IDs remain stable.
- Terminal headers show live/exited status plus the actual requested/fallback command role
  (`Codex`, `Claude`, or `Shell`) for the current project-first PTY session.
- Terminal vertical split is draggable and persisted.
- The center planning-chat surface stays available while the Macro loop strip is collapsible; the
  right execution column and terminal split are resizable, and xterm panes still use their existing
  resize observers.
- Planner composer and Macro loop presentation are polished, but provider calls, router behavior,
  dashboard usage semantics, and semi-automatic approval gates are unchanged.

Known limitations after Phase 9.1:

- Full package/app identity rename and native `.icns` / `.ico` packaging icons remain Phase 10.
- No fully automatic autopilot yet.
- Terminal output is not parsed automatically.
- Akorith does not auto-answer permission prompts or type `yes`, `1`, or similar into terminals.
- CLI startup reflects the fixed project-first mapping, not terminal-output detection.

### Project-first workspace flow (Phase 9.1.1)

Phase 9.1.1 corrects the day-to-day workspace flow without a broad redesign. The main Workspace
layout is now **Sidebar | center planning chat | right execution terminals**. The center surface
keeps provider/model controls, bridge target controls, the semi-automatic Macro loop, normal chat
messages, and the composer. Collapsing the Macro loop hides only that planning tool strip; normal
chat and the composer remain available.

The right execution column is project-first:

- With no active project folder, it shows an onboarding surface instead of blank anonymous shells.
- **Open Project** uses a main-process Electron folder dialog, validates the selected directory,
  persists/reuses a `projects` row, selects it, and refreshes the sidebar.
- **Create Project** asks for a project name in the renderer, then a parent folder in the main
  process, creates the directory with conservative name validation, persists/selects it, and
  refreshes the sidebar.
- Filesystem work for Open/Create Project is main-process only; the renderer only calls validated
  preload APIs.

Once a project with a valid path is selected, Akorith starts the execution agents through the
existing PTY/session manager:

- **Olympus (`t2`) starts `codex`** in the project cwd.
- **Atlantis (`t1`) starts `claude`** in the project cwd.
- The PTY create path accepts only fixed command kinds (`shell`, `codex`, `claude`) plus a
  validated absolute cwd. This is terminal lifecycle, not a second prompt/write path.
- If `codex` or `claude` is missing from PATH, the pane falls back to a shell in the project folder
  and prints a clear Akorith message instead of crashing.
- Terminal split resizing and the right execution-column width resize remain local renderer layout
  state; xterm panes still fit through their existing resize observers.

Phase 9.1.1 also compacts Recent chats in the sidebar, adds clearer vertical separation between
cards, and adds a subtle composer info row showing selected provider/model, last available usage
from a completed assistant response, repo-context state, and target executor. It does not add
autopilot, terminal-output parsing, or automatic permission prompt approval.

### Workspace polish + app identity (Phase 9.1.2)

Phase 9.1.2 is a focused polish/fix pass after 9.1.1; it does not start packaging.

- **Equal terminal split by default.** The execution column's two panes now divide the available
  height by `flex-grow` (Olympus = `split`, Atlantis = `100 - split`, `flex-basis: 0`) instead of
  percentage `flex-basis`, so Olympus and Atlantis open ~50/50 regardless of the fixed project
  strip + resizer heights. The split still persists to `akorith.terminalSplit` (default 50) and
  drag-resize is unchanged; xterm panes keep fitting through their existing resize observers.
- **Lighter center chat surface.** New theme tokens lift the planning area above the dark base
  while terminals stay darkest, preserving hierarchy and the muted-purple direction (no light
  theme, no neon): `--bg-chat` (#1a1922, the `.chat-panel` surface), `--bg-chat-bubble` (#232230,
  assistant bubbles), `--bg-composer` (#14131b, the composer tray). Background `--bg` (#0b0b10)
  remains the terminal column so the execution area reads darker than the thinking area.
- **Sidebar "All projects" + menu.** The `+` next to *All projects* opens a small popover menu —
  **Open Project** and **Create Project** — instead of the old inline metadata form. Open Project
  reuses the validated main-process `projects:openFolder` dialog; both actions persist/select the
  project and trigger the existing project-first terminal startup via `activeProject`.
- **Create Project modal.** A centered `.modal-overlay` dialog collects a project name and a
  parent folder. The parent is chosen through a new main-process `projects:pickDirectory` dialog
  (validated, returns the path to display); **Create Project** then calls the extended
  `projects:createFolder` with that `parentPath` (the picker is skipped when a parent is supplied).
  Name validation (`SAFE_PROJECT_DIR_NAME`, no traversal/reserved chars) and main-process-only
  filesystem work are unchanged; the renderer never touches the filesystem directly. On success
  the project is created, persisted, activated, and Olympus/Atlantis start as Codex/Claude in it.
- **Akorith app identity (dev/runtime).** `app.setName('Akorith')`, BrowserWindow `title: 'Akorith'`
  (already set), and a raster logo `assets/akorith-logo.png` used for the BrowserWindow `icon` and
  the macOS dock via `app.dock.setIcon(nativeImage…)` (SVG can't be a nativeImage, so the PNG is
  required for the dock). `resolveAppIcon()` prefers the PNG, falling back to `akorith-icon.svg`.
  Native `.icns`/`.ico` bundle identity and `package.json` `name`/`productName` remain Phase 10.
- **Layout preserved.** Sidebar | center planning chat | right execution terminals is unchanged;
  Olympus = Codex, Atlantis = Claude; collapsing the Macro loop still leaves chat + composer
  visible. No second PTY write path, no autopilot, no auto-approval of permission prompts.

### App identity + sidebar defaults (Phase 9.1.3)

Phase 9.1.3 is a focused follow-up after 9.1.2; still no packaging.

- **App identity — what's fixed in dev/runtime.** `package.json` now carries `name: "akorith"`,
  `productName: "Akorith"`, and an Akorith `description` (the only `letsgetit` string is gone;
  `name` is not self-imported anywhere, so the build/imports are unaffected — userData is pinned by
  `app.setName('Akorith')`, not the package name). The main process keeps `app.setName('Akorith')`,
  adds `app.setAboutPanelOptions({ applicationName: 'Akorith', … })`, sets the BrowserWindow
  `title: 'Akorith'`, and applies the raster dock icon. Result: the window title, the **About
  Akorith / Hide Akorith / Quit Akorith** menu roles, the About panel, and the dock *icon* all say
  Akorith.
- **App identity — the documented limitation.** Running in **dev** (`npm run dev` launches
  `node_modules/.../Electron.app`), the macOS **menu-bar bold app name** and the **dock tooltip**
  are read from that bundle's `Info.plist` (`CFBundleName` = "Electron") and **cannot be changed at
  runtime** by `app.setName` or any JS API. Overriding those two specific labels requires a
  **packaged build** whose own `Info.plist` carries `CFBundleName`/`CFBundleDisplayName` = Akorith
  (electron-builder `productName`) — that is **Phase 10**. This is the only place "Electron" can
  still appear, and only in dev.
- **Provider folders default collapsed.** The sidebar's Claude / ChatGPT / Local (Ollama) provider
  groups now default to collapsed for a cleaner first load. State is per-provider and persists in
  `localStorage` under `akorith.providerCollapsed` (a provider absent from the map reads as
  collapsed); clicking a group header expands/collapses it. The colored group cards stay visible
  when collapsed; Recent chats and project folders are unchanged.
- **Profile/settings gear icon.** `SettingsIcon` was a tangled hand-drawn path that rendered broken
  at 16px; it's replaced with a clean standard stroked gear (circle + cog outline). The profile
  button also pins both its icons with `flex: 0 0 auto` so the gear stays correctly sized, centered,
  and right-aligned in both expanded and collapsed sidebar states.
- **No regressions.** Equal Olympus/Atlantis split, lighter center chat, All-projects Open/Create
  menu + Create Project modal, project activation starting Olympus=Codex / Atlantis=Claude, the
  right execution column, chat-visible-on-macro-collapse, semi-automatic macro-loop, and the
  Dashboard/Test routes are all preserved.

### Agentic loop + product polish (Phase 11)

Phase 11 adds an optional **Auto Mode** to the macro-loop and polishes the UI, without
changing any invariant: the single write path, meta-call/no-`usage_event` accounting, and
the manual Approval flow all stand.

**Product polish.**
- *Sidebar logo* renders via an inline `<AkorithMark>` SVG (in `icons.tsx`), not
  `<img src="/akorith-icon.svg">` — an absolute `/` asset path resolves under the dev server
  but against filesystem root under `file://`, which is why the packaged logo was a broken
  box. The favicon in `index.html` is now `./akorith-icon.svg` (relative).
- *Terminal split* root-cause fix: `storageNumber` returned `Number(null)=0` when the key was
  missing, opening the split at 0/100. It now returns the fallback for missing/empty, and the
  split is clamped/`sanitizeSplit`'d to 30–70 (stale/invalid → even 50/50).
- *Theme*: lighter center chat (`--bg-chat` #201f29), light **borderless** chat bubbles
  (`--bubble-user`/`--bubble-assistant`, dark text, larger radius; dark code blocks restore
  light text inside them), a soft translucent **glass sidebar** (`--bg-sidebar` rgba +
  `backdrop-filter`, solid `@supports` fallback), and slightly larger global radii
  (`--radius-*` + a one-step bump of existing radii).

**agentic-core.ts (electron-free, headlessly verified).** Pure functions only — no terminal,
DB, or provider access — so `scripts/verify-agentic-loop.ts` exercises them directly:
- `stripAnsi` / `boundSnapshot` — clean + bound a terminal snapshot (last N lines / chars).
- `detectPermissionPrompt(snapshot)` → `{ detected, kind, suggestedAction, riskLevel,
  rationale, requiresUserReview }`. Conservative: numbered menus pick the **one-time** "Yes"
  (never an "always allow"), destructive context (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, `--force`, …) forces
  `high` risk and no auto-answer, access/permission requests always require review.
- `buildSummarizerPrompt` / `parseSummaryJson` / `heuristicSummary` — executor-result summary
  with a deterministic fallback when the model call fails or returns unusable JSON. Output:
  `changedFiles, commandsRun, testsRun, failures, currentStatus, likelyNextStep, confidence,
  needsUserAttention, source`.
- `decidePermissionPolicy({mode, detection, confidence})` → `auto_send | pause_for_user |
  ignore`. Approval Mode **never** auto-answers; Auto Mode auto-sends only low-risk, one-time,
  high-confidence (≥0.6) confirmations.
- `evaluateAutoOutcome(...)` → `continue | complete | stop | pause` (max iterations, good-enough
  threshold, repeated failures, needs-attention, low confidence). **Phase 19:** accepts an
  optional `critic` — when present its measured `progressScore` replaces the planner's predicted
  `doneScore`, a `regressed` verdict or `escalate` recommendation pauses, and a critic-confirmed
  goal completes the loop. Legacy (no-critic) behavior is unchanged.
- **Phase 19 critic/verifier** (`buildCriticPrompt` / `parseCriticReview` / `heuristicCritic` /
  `renderCriticText`): grades the *actual* result against the goal → `{ progressScore 0..100,
  verdict advanced|stalled|regressed|complete, goalMet, gaps[], recommendation
  continue|refine|done|escalate, rationale, confidence, source }`. Deterministic heuristic
  fallback (derives a grade from the summary + prior scores, detecting regression). Unit-checked
  by `scripts/verify-critic-loop.ts`. This closes the loop: plan → act → summarize → **grade** →
  re-plan, with the latest gaps fed into the next `buildPlannerPrompt`.

**Terminal snapshot API (read-only).** `PtyManager` keeps a bounded ring buffer per session
(`MAX_BUFFER_CHARS = 120k`, sliced on each `onData`). `ptyManager.snapshot(id, maxChars)` and
the `pty:snapshot` IPC / `window.api.pty.snapshot` return the raw tail only — **no write, no
exec, no filesystem**. This is the input to the summarizer/detector; it is not a second write
path.

**Orchestration (`macro.ts`).** New session field `mode` (`approval` default | `auto`).
- `summarizeTurn` reads the snapshot, calls the planner provider via `sendMetaPrompt` (a meta
  call → **no `usage_event`**) with a `heuristicSummary` fallback, and persists the summary +
  `summarizer_confidence` + `permission_detection` + `terminal_snapshot_meta` + `result_status`.
- `respondPermission` sends a short one-time token (`"1"`, `"y"`, Enter) through `bridgeSend`
  — the **same single write path**, never arbitrary commands.
- `runAutoLoop` (abortable via `activeLoops`; Stop wins at every await): propose → auto-send
  proposal (bridge) → `waitForOutput` (bounded poll, never spins) → summarize → permission
  policy (auto-answer low-risk one-time, else pause) → **`criticTurn` (Phase 19, grades the real
  result, meta call + heuristic fallback)** → `evaluateAutoOutcome` (fed the critic). Planner
  `high` risk pauses. Every automatic action is appended to the session's `auto_actions` audit
  log. `criticTurn` also runs in approval mode's `summarize` so users see the measured grade.
- The renderer polls `macro:get` (~1.5s) while a loop is active; it does not drive the loop.

**Phase 20 — autonomous workspace loop (loop-commit projects), `workspace.ts`.** Turns the loop
into a "scaffold a project → build it → commit every change as `Phase N: <change>` → stop on
budget" pipeline. `workspace.ts` is self-contained (only node builtins; git runs `shell:false`
with the commit message via `-F -` over stdin, so a headline can never reach a shell) and is
headlessly verified by `scripts/verify-workspace-loop.ts` (drives real git in a temp repo):
- Pure: `parseHighestPhase` / `buildPhaseCommitMessage` / `deriveHeadline` / `slugify` /
  `buildIdeaPrompt` / `parseProjectIdea`.
- Git IO: `initWorkspace` (mkdir + `git init` + README + "Phase 0: scaffold project"),
  `nextPhaseNumber` (highest `Phase N` in the log + 1, so numbering survives restarts),
  `commitPhase` (stage-all → no-op if nothing changed → commit "Phase N: <headline>").
- `workspace:createProject` IPC (`window.api.macro.createWorkspaceProject`): generates an
  everyday-dev idea (meta call + deterministic fallback), scaffolds a unique dir under
  `~/Documents/Akorith Projects`, `git init`s it, and binds an **auto-mode + auto-commit** macro
  session. It does NOT start the loop itself.
- **One-click (Phase 20.1)**: ran the whole create→open→start sequence from a single button.
  Superseded by the dedicated Loop section in Phase 21.
- **Loop section (Phase 21, `LoopsPage.tsx`).** The autonomous loop is now a first-class
  top-level view (`AppView 'loops'`, sidebar "Loop" item), **removed from above the chatbox**
  (the old `MacroLoopPanel` is deleted). Deliberately non-technical: a card grid of existing
  loops + a "＋" card; the create flow is a single short description ("a sentence or two"),
  persisted as `macro_sessions.title` and shown on the card. Creating a loop auto-picks the first
  available provider, calls `createWorkspaceProject`, starts a **headless** executor terminal in
  the workspace cwd (`pty.setActiveProject(projectKey)` + `pty.create('t1::<key>', {cwd,
  commandKind:'claude'})` — no visible terminal UI), then `macro:startAuto`. The detail page shows
  a live timer, the saved changes (auto-commit log → "Phase N: …"), and Pause/Resume — all
  framed in plain language; the macro/critic/token machinery stays hidden.
- **Fully automatic + steering (Phase 22).** The loop never dead-pauses waiting on the user.
  `evaluateAutoOutcome` returns only continue / complete / stop (no `pause`): soft signals
  (needs-attention, low confidence, a one-off critic regression/escalation) keep it going — the
  critic's gaps steer the next plan — and it ends only on goal-met (complete), the iteration cap,
  or `MAX_AUTO_FAILURES` consecutive failures (stop). A high planner-risk label no longer pauses
  (destructive shell ops are still gated by the permission detector). Each plan also returns
  `next_options` (3 short plain-language directions, persisted on `macro_turns.next_options`); the
  Loop detail page shows the current activity + those as steer chips. Picking one calls
  `macro:steer` → `macro_sessions.pending_steering`, which the next `propose()` folds into the
  planner prompt and clears. No pick = it continues on the default. The detail page also shows
  Stop (reject) and a Resume only for the rare system pause.
- **General-purpose tasks (Phase 23).** Loops are no longer only project generation — the user's
  prompt IS the goal (research, monitoring, building, …). `createWorkspaceProject` uses the prompt
  verbatim as the goal (idea-generation is only an empty-prompt fallback) and still scaffolds a
  git working folder for an artifact/findings history. `buildPlannerPrompt` was rewritten to be
  task-agnostic and tool-aware: it tells the agent it has web search/fetch, a shell, and file I/O,
  and to keep a single results file (e.g. FINDINGS.md) updated each step — for monitoring goals,
  to track seen items and report only what's new. The Loop detail page shows a detailed **Steps**
  timeline (each step's plan + what happened + critic score) alongside the saved-changes commits.
  NOTE: "computer use" depends on what tools the executor CLI actually exposes — Akorith passes
  the instruction through, so web/shell/files work today; native screen-control needs the agent to
  have such a tool. Recurring cadence loops are supported while Akorith is running: each turn is one
  cycle, then `runAutoLoop` waits for the configured cadence before planning the next cycle.
- **Phase 23.1: Fully Active/Passive Loop Switch.** The Loop section has a **Fully loop**
  Active/Passive control on create and detail. Active creates/keeps a loop in Auto Mode and starts
  or resumes it without another click. Passive stores the session in Approval/passive mode and
  aborts Akorith's auto driver, leaving the loop idle until the user manually resumes or switches
  it back to Active. If a prompt was already sent to the executor terminal, that terminal command
  may finish, but Akorith will not plan or send the next cycle while Passive.
- **Phase 23.2: Loop Operations Center.** The Loop section is now the product home for
  autonomous workflows: project improvement, feature loops, GitHub/repo analysis, monitoring,
  research, maintenance, and project creation. `LoopsPage.tsx` has a dashboard (Active / Needs
  attention / Completed / Failed / Commits), template cards, a progressive create flow, advanced
  schedule/stop/autonomy/safety/provider/commit/report controls, loop cards with type/target/status/
  progress/latest result, detail controls for Active/Passive, model switching, Resume/Stop/Complete/
  Duplicate/Archive/Remove, and separate Now, Safety, Run timeline, Audit trail, Saved changes, and
  Final report panels. Remove deletes the loop record only; it never deletes the workspace folder.
- **Phase 23.2 data model.** `macro_sessions` remains the compatibility spine, now with additive
  Loop fields: `loop_type`, `target_type`, `target_ref`, `schedule_kind`, `schedule_detail`,
  `next_run_at`, `stop_condition`, `max_runs`, `max_commits`, `run_count`, `commit_behavior`,
  `push_enabled`, `test_commands`, `report_format`, `safety_level`, `latest_result`, and
  `archived_at`. New tables reserve the durable product model: `loop_targets`, `loop_runs`,
  `loop_events`, `loop_templates`, `loop_artifacts`, and `loop_reports`. Automatic actions still
  append to `macro_sessions.auto_actions`, and now also mirror into `loop_events`; each Auto cycle
  records a `loop_runs` row with summary, changed files, commands, tests/builds, commits, next step,
  and errors.
- **Phase 23.2 execution behavior.** `workspace:createProject` can now bind a loop to an existing
  local project path (conservatively: no scaffold/write on bind) or create a fresh Akorith workspace.
  Project loops use the loop workspace for `buildDigest()` instead of the app cwd. Planner prompts
  include a structured Loop profile plus safety rules. Auto-commit returns an explicit result, and
  project-like loops no longer mark themselves complete when the critic claims success but no files
  changed and no commit was made. Archive/remove IPC channels abort active drivers first.
- **Phase 24: Loop Completion.** Loop workspaces are first-class AkorithLoop outputs. The default
  loop repository is `https://github.com/saitakarcesme/AkorithLoop.git`, each loop lives in its own
  folder under `~/Documents/AkorithLoop`, and commit-producing loops force `push_enabled=true`
  even if a stale renderer payload says otherwise. `workspace.ts` exposes read-only
  `inspectLoopWorkspace()` plus `syncAndPushLoopWorkspace()`; `macro:inspectWorkspace` and
  `macro:syncWorkspace` are validated IPC endpoints. The Loop detail UI shows GitHub sync state
  (remote, branch, path-scoped commit count, latest phase, ahead/behind, dirty file count, head),
  and the **Sync to AkorithLoop** button records success/failure in `loop_events`. `loop_runs` and
  `loop_events` now have typed list APIs and render as Run ledger / Event log panels, so restarts
  do not hide what happened. `npm run verify:workspace-loop` is the canonical headless check for
  Phase-N commit numbering and loop workspace inspection.
- **Phase 25: Test Lab Rebuild.** Test Lab is now a guided user flow rather than a developer
  control panel. The primary English path is: choose the source (saved project, folder picker, or
  GitHub URL), choose the local Ollama model that writes the test, choose a fixed test subject
  preset (including **General coverage**, no free-form topic required), choose the result judge
  (Local, Claude, or ChatGPT), then run the test and automatically export a PDF. Local folders and
  GitHub clones are copied into a temporary sandbox before generated tests are written; the source
  repo remains read-only. Runner details stay collapsed as an escape hatch for auto-detection
  misses. A successful run now auto-scores with the selected judge, exports the PDF, and keeps the
  run locked until the report path is available. Historical runs can still be re-scored from the
  Review and PDF section. The PDF template is branded as an Akorith Test Report with verdict,
  ISAScore, metadata, objective metrics, run evidence, score breakdown, judge rationale, generated
  test excerpts, and bounded output excerpts.
- **Phase 26: Settings Center.** The profile footer now opens a real Settings Center instead of a
  small single-column popover. `SettingsCenter.tsx` owns five English sections: Profile
  (display name, light/dark theme, summary chips), Providers (registry availability plus Ollama
  endpoint, LAN/VPN suggestions, auto-start/LAN/discovery toggles), Workflow (bridge Auto-Enter,
  repo-context toggle/path, read-only AkorithLoop remote/folder), Test Lab (default source,
  install-deps toggle, timeout, retained sandboxes, report identity), and Data (local storage and
  safety boundaries). Existing validated IPC remains the only write path for each setting:
  `settings:*` for theme, `ollama:*` for local provider settings, `bridge:*` for Auto-Enter,
  `digest:*` for repo context, and the new `test:setSettings` for Test Lab defaults. The Settings
  Center does not introduce terminal writes, provider sends, secret storage, or filesystem writes
  from the renderer.
- **No permission stalls (Phase 22.1).** The loop's headless executor launches in bypass mode —
  new `pty` command kinds `claude-auto` (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) / `codex-auto`
  (`codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`); the user-driven workspace keeps the plain
  interactive kinds. And `runAutoLoop` no longer pauses on a detected prompt — it auto-answers the
  safe default and continues (blast radius is the loop's own throwaway project folder).
- In `runAutoLoop`: after the critic, `maybeAutoCommit` commits the turn's work as the next
  `Phase N`; a metered meta-call **token budget** (`token_budget`, accumulated into `tokens_used`
  by `recordMetaUsage` on every planner/critic/summarizer call; `0` = unlimited) stops the loop
  with `token_budget_reached`. Only the loop's own meta calls are metered — the external executor
  agent's tokens are not visible to Akorith.

**Persistence (additive, safe `ensureColumn` migrations).** `macro_sessions`: `mode`,
`auto_actions` (JSON), `pause_reason`, and **Phase 20** `workspace_dir`, `auto_commit`,
`token_budget`, `tokens_used`, **Phase 21** `title`, and **Phase 22** `pending_steering`.
`macro_turns`: `summarizer_confidence`,
`permission_detection` (JSON), `terminal_snapshot_meta` (JSON), `auto_action`, `result_status`,
**Phase 19** `critic_score`, `critic_verdict`, `critic_review` (JSON), and **Phase 22**
`next_options` (JSON). **Phase 23.2** adds the Loop metadata columns listed above plus
`loop_targets`, `loop_runs`, `loop_events`, `loop_templates`, `loop_artifacts`, and
`loop_reports`. Verified present in the packaged app's DB schema.

**Safety summary.** Default is Approval Mode (unchanged Phase 9 flow). Auto Mode is opt-in with
a visible note, never auto-selects "always allow", never auto-answers medium/high-risk or
low-confidence prompts, pauses on failures/attention, and Stop always aborts. Planner +
summarizer are meta calls and never touch the dashboard.

### Codex-quality light UI + persistent history (Phase 13)

Phase 13 is a product-feel phase: a light/neutral "developer workbench" look and workspace
continuity. No functional invariant changed — same IPC, same single write path, same safety.

**Theme token architecture (the whole change is token-first).** `:root` now defines a *light*
neutral system: workspace base `--bg` #f4f4f3, panels `--bg-panel` #fff, center chat
`--bg-chat` #fafafa, dark-neutral text, a restrained muted-indigo accent (`--accent` #6257c9),
black-alpha `--border-soft`, and `--hover`/`--hover-strong`/`--on-accent` tokens. Two areas keep
their own **scoped dark token overrides** so they stay dark on the light app:
`.terminal-column` (the whole right execution subtree — headers, chips, onboarding) and
`.chat-code` / `.test-terminal-col` (dark code/terminal surfaces carry light text). xterm content
is themed in JS, independent of CSS. The old lavender `rgba(169,150,255,…)` accent was unified to
the new indigo `rgba(98,87,201,…)` everywhere (focus rings, tints, selection).

**Light/white sidebar.** `.sidebar` gets its own token scope (`--sidebar-*`): white background,
dark text, gray icons, a hairline border, calm black-alpha hovers, and a subtle indigo
active state. Provider colors survive only as small chips/tints, not loud blocks. A polished
empty state (no projects) shows Open Project / Create Project CTAs reusing the existing flow.

**Persistent workspace history (Part A).** On launch, `App.tsx` restores the last active project
from `localStorage` `akorith.lastActiveProjectId` (looks it up in `projects.list()`), so the app
resumes previous work instead of opening empty. Restoring re-starts that project's Codex/Claude
terminals **only** through the existing safe PTY startup (a logged-in CLI launch in the project
cwd — never a destructive command) and the panes show visible live/exited status, so the resume
is never hidden. `akorith.lastActiveSessionId` is also persisted; recent chats stay one click to
resume. Sidebar collapse, provider-folder collapse (default collapsed), terminal split (clamped
30–70, null-safe), and display name were already persisted in earlier phases. Projects and recent
chats are listed recency-first from SQLite.

**Other surfaces.** Light chat bubbles (white assistant card with a hairline border; faint-tint
user bubble); a filled-accent primary Send button; the BrowserWindow `backgroundColor` is now
light (`#f4f4f3`) to avoid a dark first-paint flash. Radius system tightened to a consistent
8/11/14/18. Motion still respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Manual UI inspection (REAL).** The packaged app was launched and screenshotted
(`docs/validation/phase13-ui.png`): white sidebar with logo/nav/empty-state/recent-chats/profile,
light planning chat with macro-loop Approval/Auto toggle and filled Send, dark right execution
column. Menu bar shows "Akorith". Reads as a calm, intentional developer product.

### Chat-first Codex-style workspace (Phase 13.1)

Phase 13.1 is a **structural** UI pass (not just colors): the workspace becomes chat-first with
terminals hidden behind an activity drawer. Backend/orchestration/security are untouched.

**Layout shift.** The old `Sidebar | ChatPanel | TerminalColumn` becomes `Sidebar | ChatPanel`
(full-width chat-first), plus an `AgentDrawer` overlay. `App.tsx` no longer renders
`TerminalColumn` (the file is kept but unused); the right-side "Open a project to start agents"
onboarding is gone — project open/create is **sidebar-first** (the center hero just routes back to
that flow via `onOpenProject`/`onCreateProject`, the latter bumping `createSignal` so the sidebar
opens its existing create modal).

**Theme flip.** `:root` is now a **dark** Codex workspace (bg `#1a1a1d`, panels `#232327`, light
text) with a **near-monochrome accent** (`--accent` near-white `#ededf0`, `--on-accent` dark) — no
purple/indigo (the old indigo was globally replaced with white-alpha; a `--focus-ring` token was
added). The **sidebar keeps its own light scope** (`.sidebar { --sidebar-* }`) and now also
overrides surface tokens (`--bg-panel`/`--bg-raised`/`--bg-input`) to light + inverts the accent
(dark CTA on white) + a dark focus ring, so no dark surface leaks into the white sidebar. The
create modal (mounted inside the sidebar) uses `--bg-panel` so it's a readable light dialog.

**Agent drawer = background agents (`AgentDrawer.tsx`).** The two `TerminalPane`s (Olympus=Codex
`t2`, Atlantis=Claude `t1`) live here. The drawer is **always mounted while a project with a path
is active** and toggled by a CSS `translateX` — so closing it only hides it; the PTYs and their
snapshot buffers keep running (closing never kills agents). Opening reveals the live panes (already
sized, so xterm stays fitted). Selecting/opening/creating a project starts the agents in the
background immediately. `TerminalPane` gained an `onStatus` callback; statuses bubble through
`App` to a header **agent-status chip** ("Codex & Claude ready" / "Agents starting…" / shell-
fallback warning) so the user knows agents run without opening the drawer. The single write path
(`bridgeSend → PtyManager.write`) is unchanged.

**Chat-first ChatPanel.** Three states: (1) **no project** → centered hero "What should we work
on?" + Open/Create buttons (composer hidden); (2) **project, no messages** → hero "What should we
build in <project>?" + the large centered composer; (3) **conversation** → a centered max-760px
message column (Codex-style full-width turns, subtle user block, borderless assistant text) with
the composer docked at the bottom. The composer is one large rounded dark surface with inline
controls: target route (Olympus/Atlantis), Repo, Auto-Enter, ✦ Suggest, Show agents, Send/Stop.

**Macro-loop integrated.** `MacroLoopPanel` (unchanged engine/state) now renders **inside the
composer**, collapsed by default, restyled compact/dark (a status-chip head when collapsed;
proposal/result/permission cards when expanded). Approval/Auto toggle, status, and Stop are part
of the composer flow rather than a top debug strip.

**Manual UI inspection (REAL).** Packaged app launched + screenshotted
(`docs/validation/phase13-1-ui.png`): light simplified sidebar (compact provider rows, no color
blocks), dark Codex workspace, centered "What should we work on?" hero with Open/Create, top-bar
provider/model + Activity. No right terminal column, no purple. Project-active states (hero
composer, conversation, drawer) are code-verified (GUI click-through needs macOS Accessibility,
unavailable here — same limitation as Phase 12/13).

### Chat workflow polish + agent output feedback (Phase 13.2)

Phase 13.2 polishes the chat-first workspace and adds **terminal-output → chat summaries**.

- **Agent output summaries (the headline feature).** New sessionless main-process IPC
  `agent:summarize` (in `macro.ts`, `summarizeAgentOutput`): reads a **read-only** terminal
  snapshot, builds the agentic-core summarizer prompt, calls `sendMetaPrompt` (**meta call → no
  `usage_event`**) with the `heuristicSummary` fallback, and returns `{ summary, detection,
  signature }`; it returns a "No meaningful new output yet." signal when the snapshot is
  essentially empty. Exposed via `window.api.agent.summarize`. In `ChatPanel`, after a bridge
  send Akorith auto-summarizes once after a bounded delay (`AUTO_SUMMARY_DELAY_MS = 6000`),
  **deduped by `signature`** so unchanged output never spams; a manual **"Summarize output"**
  composer chip does the same on demand. The result is appended as a chat **summary card**
  (`.is-summary`, source = "Olympus / Codex" or "Atlantis / Claude") with status / files /
  commands / tests / failures / next step, and a permission-prompt note when detected. No second
  PTY write path; summaries are meta calls only.
- **Agent drawer resize + per-terminal collapse.** `AgentDrawer` is width-resizable (left-edge
  handle, persisted `akorith.drawerWidth`, clamped 380–980) and each agent collapses
  independently (persisted `akorith.olympusCollapsed`/`akorith.atlantisCollapsed`) — a collapsed
  pane shrinks to its header and the other takes the height; the split resizer shows only when
  both are expanded. `TerminalPane` gained `collapsed`/`onToggleCollapse` (header chevron); the
  host is hidden via CSS when collapsed so **the PTY stays alive** (collapse/close never kills
  agents). Closing the drawer is still just a transform.
- **Composer focus.** Replaced the thick/ring focus with a subtle Codex treatment — soft gray
  border + faint background lift, no glow; the textarea's own `:focus-visible` outline is removed
  (the box owns focus).
- **Dashboard colors (identity-based).** `Dashboard.colorOf` now maps by provider identity:
  **Claude = orange `#d08a4f`, ChatGPT/Codex = blue `#5a93d8`, Local/Ollama = purple `#9a8fe0`**
  (donut, stacked bars, legend dots, chips). The bar cursor tint is neutralized.
- **GitHub-style heatmap.** 11px adjacent squares, tight 3px gap, 7-row week columns, with a
  single-hue green intensity ramp (`--success`) instead of grayscale pills.
- **Chat spacing.** Wider message padding (`30px 32px`), centered max-720px column with
  `margin:auto`, and breathing room on user/assistant blocks; composer dock matches the column.
- **Sidebar brand = text only.** Removed the `<AkorithMark>` logo from the sidebar header;
  expanded shows "Akorith" + "Agent orchestration", collapsed shows a compact "A". The dock/app
  icon is separate.
- **New app icon (native macOS composition).** Source: `~/Downloads/akorithlogolatest.png`
  (purple/green marble gradient with a white `Ak` mark, 1254²). The raw square was making the Dock
  icon look un-native, so a Swift/CoreGraphics step (`/tmp/mkicon.swift`, AppKit + `CGContext`)
  composes a proper macOS icon: a 1024² canvas, the logo clipped into a rounded "body" (~824² inset
  ≈100px, corner radius ≈0.2247·body), transparent outer corners, and a subtle baked contact shadow.
  That rounded master is written to `assets/akorith-logo.png` (the runtime dock/window icon — note
  `app.dock.setIcon` overrides the bundle icon while running, so this MUST be the rounded version)
  and `build/icon.png`, and regenerated into `build/icon.icns` (sips → full `.iconset` 16–1024px →
  iconutil) and `build/icon.ico` (sips + a dependency-free Node packer → multi-size 16–256 PNG-backed
  ICO). The packaged bundle uses the new rounded `icon.icns`; the text-only sidebar/header brand mark
  and the SVG favicon are intentionally left unchanged. To regenerate: run the Swift composer on the
  source, then the `sips`/`iconutil` iconset steps. macOS caches Dock/Finder icons aggressively —
  after replacing the app, refresh with `touch dist/mac-arm64/Akorith.app && killall Dock Finder`
  (or re-login) if the old square lingers.

**Manual UI inspection (REAL).** Packaged app launched + screenshotted
(`docs/validation/phase13-2-ui.png`) in the project-active state: text-only "Akorith" brand,
top-bar agent-status chip "Codex & Claude ready" + Activity, hero "What should we build in
<project>?" with the integrated MACRO LOOP bar + dark composer (route / Repo / Auto-Enter /
Suggest / **Summarize output** / Show agents / Send), light sidebar with compact provider rows.
Dashboard colors/heatmap, drawer resize/collapse, and conversation spacing are code-verified
(GUI click-through needs macOS Accessibility, unavailable here).

### Usability fixes — per-project agents + test-lab presets (Phase 13.3)

- **Per-project agent session preservation (the fix).** PTY sessions are now keyed
  `t1::<projectId>` / `t2::<projectId>` (AgentDrawer builds the composite id; App calls
  `pty.setActiveProject(projectKey)` so the logical bridge targets `t1`/`t2` resolve to the active
  project's session). `PtyManager.create` **reuses** an already-live session for the same project
  cwd/command instead of kill+respawn, so switching projects and back keeps the running
  Codex/Claude; if project metadata changes to a different cwd, the stale PTY is replaced through
  the normal lifecycle path. `TerminalPane` no longer kills on unmount (detach only) and **replays
  the snapshot buffer** on re-attach. Bounded to `MAX_LIVE_PROJECTS = 3` (oldest project's sessions
  evicted). Still one write path (`bridgeSend → PtyManager.write`); `write`/`resize`/`kill`/
  `snapshot`/`isAlive` resolve logical → active.
- **Terminal restore handle.** A collapsed Olympus/Atlantis shows a clickable restore bar
  ("click to restore"); the chevron also toggles. Collapse hides the host but keeps the PTY alive.
- **Test Lab simple mode.** Project/repo selector uses workspace project paths (with custom path
  still editable). The main flow is repo -> test type (Debug regression / Security holes / Core
  unit logic / Edge cases / UI behavior) -> Local/Ollama test generation. Repo detection owns the
  framework/command/path and the editable runner details sit behind a **Runner details**
  `<details>`. ISAScore quality judging is a later explicit step with Claude or ChatGPT only.
- **Macro-loop simplification.** "Include repo context" → **"Repo context"** with help line
  *"Adds a compact project digest so Akorith understands your codebase. Better planning, more
  tokens."*; planner/model/executor/max/threshold moved behind an **Advanced** `<details>`; start
  button reads **"Plan with loop"** (Approval default) / "Start Auto loop"; Stop stays visible.
- **Small UI.** Recent-chat leading provider dots removed; collapsed sidebar profile centered;
  composer focus / dashboard colors / GitHub-style heatmap / centered chat column were settled in
  13.2 and retained.

### UI, Windows icon, local-provider, and chat polish (Phases 14.5-14.6)

Phases 14.5 and 14.6 are focused manual-feedback polish passes. No architecture or security
invariants changed: contextIsolation/sandbox/no nodeIntegration stay on, the contextBridge stays
frozen and validated, prompts still go to CLIs over stdin, the single `bridgeSend -> PtyManager.write`
path remains the only programmatic terminal write path, and provider sends still persist exactly one
normal-chat `usage_event`.

- **Windows icon fix (14.5).** `build/icon.ico` is included in packaged files and Windows resolves
  the BrowserWindow icon from it before falling back to PNG/SVG. Local unpacked builds can be
  stamped with the same `.ico`, so the exe, shortcuts, and taskbar show Akorith instead of the
  generic Electron icon.
- **Local/Ollama reliability (14.5).** The Local provider keeps the configured base URL but, for the
  default `http://localhost:11434`, retries `http://127.0.0.1:11434` when probing `/api/tags`. This
  covers Windows localhost resolution oddities while preserving custom base URLs.
- **Claude token accounting (14.5).** Claude cache counters are no longer shown as fresh prompt
  tokens. `promptTokens` now uses direct `input_tokens` only; the raw provider event still carries
  cache creation/read counters for audit, but tiny follow-up questions no longer show inflated
  visible usage.
- **Readability/UI fixes (14.5).** Native select popup options are forced to dark text on a white
  option background, and the app gets a small readability bump for chat, controls, sidebar, code,
  and terminal text.
- **Sidebar hover stability (14.6).** Recent-chat/provider row actions are absolute overlays with
  reserved row padding and opacity transitions, so hovering a row no longer changes text width or
  pushes neighboring content around.
- **Personalized empty chat (14.6).** Fresh general chats greet the local profile name
  (`Welcome back, Ibrahim`) and keep the project workspace empty state unchanged.
- **Collapsed brand (14.6).** The collapsed sidebar shows the inline Akorith mark instead of a
  plain letter.
- **Assistant message presentation (14.6).** Assistant text segments now render lightweight
  Markdown-style prose: paragraphs, ordered/unordered lists, `**bold**`, and inline code. This
  improves the visual quality of model output without changing model prompts or provider behavior.

### Logo, sidebar scroll, and copyable output polish (Phase 14.7)

Phase 14.7 is another manual-feedback UI polish pass. No architecture/security invariants changed.

- **Collapsed logo uses the current app icon.** The renderer now ships
  `src/renderer/public/akorith-logo.png` copied from `assets/akorith-logo.png`, and collapsed
  sidebar branding renders that PNG instead of the older inline SVG mark.
- **Sidebar scroll scope.** `.sidebar-scroll` is the single scroll container for everything from
  Projects through provider folders and Recent Chats. The profile/settings area stays fixed at the
  bottom. Project lists and Recent Chats no longer own separate nested scroll containers.
- **Copyable output in General Chat.** Fenced assistant blocks now always render a **Copy** button.
  Workspace chats still also show the existing Send-to-agent button, so project workflows keep the
  bridge affordance while general chats gain a direct copy path.
- **Lighter copy/code boxes.** Fenced blocks use a lighter dark surface, larger monospace text, a
  more readable header, and grouped action buttons. This is presentation-only; provider prompts and
  model behavior are unchanged.

### Chat scroll reliability + sidebar project polish (Phase 14.4)

Phase 14.4 is a focused usability bugfix pass over the latest manual testing. No new architecture,
no signing/notarization, no redesign. All invariants unchanged (contextIsolation/sandbox/no
nodeIntegration, frozen contextBridge, untrusted text via stdin, native modules main-only, the
single `bridgeSend → PtyManager.write()` write path, Approval Mode default, meta calls write no
`usage_events`, Workspace/General separation, per-project PTY reuse).

- **Chat scroll trap (the headline bug) — root cause.** Across phases, `.chat-messages` accumulated
  two rules that together made the scroll container `display:flex; flex-direction:column;
  justify-content:center; overflow-y:auto`. A flex container that **centers** its content along the
  scroll axis cannot scroll to the *start* once the content overflows — the top is laid out above
  the scrollable range and clipped. So whenever a chat was tall enough (especially with a large
  code/prompt block), everything **above** that block became unreachable. It looked restore-specific
  only because restored chats are long. **Fix:** `.chat-messages` is now `display:block`; the inner
  `.chat-messages-col` centers itself horizontally with `margin: 0 auto` and flows top→bottom, so the
  full history scrolls. Added `overflow-anchor: none` (so explicit scroll-to-bottom is never fought
  by scroll anchoring), larger bottom padding (last turn clears the docked composer), and hard
  bounds on code blocks (`.chat-code`/`pre`: `max-width:100%`, `overflow-x:auto`, `overflow-y:hidden`)
  so a long line scrolls the block horizontally and never blocks vertical page scroll. Auto-scroll
  behavior is unchanged: it only snaps to bottom when the user is already near the bottom
  (`nearBottomRef`), and a restored chat opens at the bottom but scrolls fully up.
- **Project `⋯` menu now opens.** It was rendered `position:absolute` inside the Projects list, which
  is `overflow-y:auto` — so it was clipped/hidden. It now renders **fixed-position**, anchored to the
  clicked button's `getBoundingClientRect()` (stored as `{ id, top, right }`), escaping the list's
  clip. Closes on backdrop click and on **Escape**. Items: **Rename**, **Reveal in Finder**, and
  **Remove from Akorith** (unchanged DB-only removal + the "does not delete files from disk" confirm;
  removing the active project falls back to a clean no-project Workspace).
- **Reveal in Finder.** New read-only IPC `projects:reveal` → `getProject(id)` + `shell
  .showItemInFolder(project.path)`; preload `projects.reveal`. Disabled in the menu when the project
  has no path. No write/exec surface.
- **Projects list is a folder list, not cards.** Each row (`.project-row`) is `FolderIcon` + name +
  muted path — the avatar/letter block is gone. Active project = subtle gray fill, hover is subtle,
  comfortable row height, `⋯` reveals on hover/active/open. The Projects header keeps its collapse
  arrow, folder icon, count badge, and `+` menu; the list still shows only real projects (no
  `All projects` row).
- **Global UI scale.** `mainWindow.webContents.setZoomFactor(1.1)` is applied on every
  `did-finish-load` (so it survives reloads). One uniform ~10% enlargement of every font/control/
  spacing — the layout viewport reflows, so nothing is clipped — chosen over scattering per-component
  font-size bumps. Sidebar fixed width scales with it (intended).
- **Validation.** `docs/validation/chat-scroll-validation.md` documents the repro and the manual
  scroll/menu/scale checks. All existing verify scripts still pass (`verify-macro-loop`,
  `verify-testlab`, `verify-agentic-loop`, `verify-conversation-context`, `verify-bridge-autoenter`).
- **Known limitations.** The UI scale is a single fixed factor (1.1), not a user preference; an open
  project menu does not reposition if the list is scrolled underneath it (the full-screen backdrop
  intercepts first, so it closes on interaction); Reveal in Finder is macOS Finder / OS file manager
  via Electron `shell` and is a no-op for path-less projects (menu item disabled).

### Sidebar cleanup + bridge auto-enter fix (Phase 14.3)

Phase 14.3 is a focused bugfix/usability pass over the latest manual screenshots. No new
architecture, no signing/notarization, no redesign. Security invariants are unchanged
(contextIsolation/sandbox/no nodeIntegration, frozen contextBridge, untrusted text via stdin,
native modules main-only, the single `bridgeSend → PtyManager.write()` write path, Approval Mode
default, meta calls write no `usage_events`, Workspace/General separation, per-project PTY reuse).

- **Auto-Enter bridge fix (the headline bug).** `Send to Atlantis/Olympus` pasted the prompt but,
  even with Auto-Enter ON, did not submit it. Root cause: `encodeForPty` appended the submit `\r`
  to the **same** write as the bracketed paste; the `claude`/`codex` TUIs treat that trailing `\r`
  as part of the paste and never run it. **Fix:** the pure encoding moved to an electron-free
  `src/main/bridge-core.ts` (`encodeForPty`, `SUBMIT_KEY = '\r'`, `planBridgeWrites`). `bridgeSend`
  now writes the paste, then — only when Auto-Enter is ON — writes the Enter as a **separate**
  keystroke after `SUBMIT_DELAY_MS` (90 ms), so it lands as a discrete submit once the paste has
  settled. Both writes still go through `PtyManager.write()` — **no second write path**. Auto-Enter
  OFF writes the paste only (manual Enter preserved); the Enter is never fused onto the paste and is
  never double-sent. This covers every send: message-level `Send to …` buttons, the composer
  send-to-agent flow, the macro-loop approval send (`macro.ts`, `autoEnter: true`), and the
  permission-answer send. Unit-checked by `scripts/verify-bridge-autoenter.ts`.
- **Remove projects from Akorith.** Each project row gains a `⋯` overflow menu with **Rename** and
  **Remove from Akorith**. `projects:delete` → `deleteProject(id)` deletes the project row and its
  workspace chats (messages cascade) from the local DB inside one transaction — it **never** touches
  the folder on disk. A confirmation modal says so verbatim ("This removes the project from Akorith.
  It does not delete files from disk."). If the removed project is active, the UI falls back to a
  clean no-project Workspace (`onSelectProject(null)`); unrelated project PTY sessions are left alone
  (bounded eviction handles them). Rename uses the existing `projects:update`.
- **Delete recent chats.** Each Recent-chats entry gains a two-click **Delete** (reusing
  `history:delete`; messages cascade). Deleting the active chat opens a clean new chat / clean state.
  The Recent row became a `div role="button"` so the delete control isn't an invalid nested button.
- **Projects list cleanup.** The `All projects` row inside the Projects folder is removed; the list
  now shows only real opened/created projects. The folder header, the `+` Open/Create menu, and the
  empty-state Open/Create actions all remain, so opening/creating projects is unchanged.
- **Collapsed sidebar profile.** When collapsed, the bottom profile button holds a single icon,
  which (as `svg:last-child`) inherited `margin-left:auto` + the dim `--text-faint`, so it looked
  shoved right and broken. Collapsed-mode CSS now zeroes that margin, restores `color: inherit`, and
  sizes the button (44×42, radius 11) to match the collapsed nav items. Clicking still opens
  settings; the expanded profile area is unchanged.
- **DB/IPC/preload surface.** New `deleteProject(projectId)` + `projects:delete` IPC; preload adds
  `projects.remove(projectId)` (typed in `index.d.ts`). No schema migration needed (the existing
  `sessions.project_id` FK already isolates per-project chats).
- **Known limitations.** Project removal is DB-only and irreversible from the UI (the disk folder is
  intentionally never deleted; re-add via Open Project). Recent-chat delete removes the whole session
  (messages cascade) rather than only hiding it. The deferred Auto-Enter uses a fixed 90 ms delay
  (not adaptive to TUI readiness); a removed active project's agent PTYs stay alive until normal
  recency eviction rather than being force-killed.

### Conversation memory + context reliability (Phase 14.2)

Phase 14.2 fixes a critical product bug: the chat UI showed history, but the model never
received it, so a visible session behaved as if it had no memory. Security invariants are
unchanged (single `bridgeSend → PtyManager.write()` path, meta calls write no `usage_events`,
contextIsolation/sandbox/frozen contextBridge, Workspace/General separation, per-project PTY
reuse).

- **Root cause.** `chat:send` (`providers/registry.ts`) sent only the current prompt to
  `provider.send()`. Every provider is single-shot/stateless (`claude -p` over stdin, `codex`
  CLI, Ollama single-message), so prior turns — though persisted per session in the DB — were
  never read back into the request.
- **The fix — assemble per-session context.** A new electron-free core `src/main/conversation.ts`
  turns a session's stored messages into a bounded provider prompt. `chat:send` now loads the
  session's prior messages (`getSessionMessages`, strictly `WHERE session_id = ?`) **before**
  persisting the new one, then `renderProviderPrompt` frames them as an ongoing conversation
  (role-tagged turns, new message last). Memory is keyed only by `session_id`, so there is no
  cross-chat or cross-project leakage, and General vs Workspace sessions stay separate.
- **Bounded context policy.** `selectContextWindow` keeps the recent turns verbatim, bounded by
  count (`recentVerbatim = 24`) and chars (`maxChars = 48k`), always keeping the newest message.
  Past that, older turns are compressed into a **cached session summary** via `sendMetaPrompt`
  (a meta call — **no `usage_event`**), stored on `sessions.context_summary` /
  `context_summary_count` and regenerated only when the older window grows. Recent turns are
  always verbatim.
- **New Chat / restore are context-safe.** New Chat opens a fresh `session_id` (no prior
  memory). Restoring a Recent Chat reloads that session's messages and its real memory stats.
  Switching projects restores that project's session.
- **Memory indicator + reset control** under the composer: `Memory: N msgs` (+ `summarized K`,
  + `Repo on` for Workspace), a tooltip explaining what the model sees, and a two-click
  **Reset context** that clears ONLY the active session (`history:clearMessages`). Backed by the
  read-only `chat:contextInfo` IPC (no model call).
- **Agent summaries join session memory.** `agent:summarize` accepts the active `sessionId` and
  persists the summary as an assistant message in that one session, so later follow-ups in the
  same Workspace chat can reference what the agent did. Still a meta call (no `usage_event`).
- **DB migrations.** Additive: `sessions.context_summary TEXT`, `sessions.context_summary_count
  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`. New helpers: `getSessionMessages`, `getContextSummary`,
  `setContextSummary`, `clearSessionMessages`. New IPC: `chat:contextInfo`,
  `history:clearMessages`.
- **Validation.** `scripts/verify-conversation-context.ts` unit-checks the assembly/bounded
  logic; `scripts/memory-behavioral-check.ts` proves it end-to-end against the **real `claude`
  CLI** (4/4: recalls a fact with memory; the no-memory baseline does not; a separate chat does
  not leak; multi-turn recall works). See `docs/validation/conversation-memory-validation.md`.
- **Known limitations.** Older-context summarization is model-generated and conservative
  (recent turns always verbatim); the behavioral harness exercises the `claude` CLI (the
  logged-in provider) though all providers share the same assembly; the indicator's token figure
  is approximate; context is assembled as an in-prompt transcript (the uniform approach for
  single-shot CLIs), not a provider-specific multi-message API.

### Chat workflow + Test Lab reliability (Phase 14.1)

Phase 14.1 is a focused fix pass over real workflow bugs found in manual use. No new
architecture, no signing/notarization, no redesign. Security invariants are unchanged
(contextIsolation/sandbox/no nodeIntegration, frozen contextBridge, untrusted text via stdin,
native modules main-only, the single `bridgeSend → PtyManager.write()` write path, Approval Mode
default, meta calls write no `usage_events`).

- **Sidebar "New chat".** The separate **Chat** nav item is gone. A dedicated **New chat** action
  sits above **Workspace** (order: New chat · Workspace · Dashboard · Test). Each click calls
  `App.startNewGeneralChat()` which always opens a *fresh* general chat (`selectHistory(null,
  'general')`, never loads the latest), with no project, no project title, and the user's current
  default provider. General chats still appear in Recent Chats as **General chat**. Workspace stays
  project-scoped. Provider-folder `+` buttons still start a fresh general chat for that provider.
- **Prominent model switcher.** The two provider/model `<select>`s are wrapped in a pill
  (`.model-switcher`) with a "MODEL" label in the workspace top bar — clearer selected provider/model,
  better spacing, still compact. Works in both Workspace and General Chat. Switching provider mid-thread
  clears the (provider-bound) session as before.
- **Chat scroll.** The conversation area auto-scrolls to the newest message **only when the user is
  already near the bottom** (`nearBottomRef`, 120px threshold tracked `onScroll`). Scrolling up to read
  history is never interrupted. Opening/switching a session resets to the bottom. The composer stays
  docked at the bottom; the empty state stays centered.
- **Readable chat + code blocks.** Chat content is 15px / 1.72 line-height with a `72ch` max text
  width; fenced code/prompt blocks get more padding, a softer border, a rounded raised surface, a
  13px monospace font, and horizontal scroll for long lines (Phase 14.1 CSS block, appended last).
- **Lighter dark surfaces.** Workspace base tokens were lifted a notch (`--bg #1a1a1d → #232327`,
  panel/raised/composer in step) for a more readable dark gray (still Codex-dark, no light theme, no
  purple). The Test page sandbox output (`TestTerminal` xterm theme + `.test-terminal-col`) moved from
  near-black `#0b0b10`/`#0e0e13` to a lighter, readable `#1b1b22`.
- **Terminal permission prompts surfaced in chat.** A new **read-only** `agent:detectPermission`
  IPC (`window.api.agent.detectPermission(terminalId)`) runs the existing `detectPermissionPrompt`
  over a terminal snapshot. ChatPanel polls the current bridge target every 4s while a project
  workspace is open, and renders a compact **permission card** (source agent Olympus/Codex or
  Atlantis/Claude · the detected question · answer buttons · **Open Activity** · **Dismiss**).
  `detectPermissionPrompt` now also returns `question` and concrete `options[]` (numbered menus
  surface one button per option; yes/no → Yes/No; allow-access → Allow once/Deny; press-enter →
  Press Enter). Answers are sent through the **existing** bridge (`bridge.send → PtyManager.write()`)
  — no second write path. Permanent "always allow" options are surfaced but never auto-selected;
  in Approval Mode the card always waits for the user; Auto-Mode safety gates are untouched.
- **Reliable agent-output summary.** After a bridge send (or a permission answer), the auto-summary
  no longer fires on one fixed 6s delay — it **polls the target terminal's snapshot until output
  stabilizes** (unchanged across 2 polls) or a 45s deadline, then summarizes once (deduped by
  signature). A newer send supersedes an older watcher (`summaryWatch` token). The summary appears
  in the active chat (project workspace for project work; general chat only if started there). The
  manual **Summarize output** button still surfaces the "no meaningful output" state. Summarizer
  calls remain meta calls — no `usage_events`.
- **Test Lab reliability.** A new read-only `test:context` IPC (`buildRepoContext` in `testlab.ts`)
  returns a bounded source-file tree + a few small importable sample files. TestPage prepends this to
  the generation prompt and adds framework-specific rules (real imports of real export names, correct
  pytest/vitest/jest syntax, ≥3 real executable tests, no network/DB/browser deps, no empty
  describe/"0 tests"). A **Repair & rerun** button feeds a failing test file + sandbox output back to
  the model for a corrected file and reruns once in a fresh sandbox (source stays read-only). Framework
  **detection** was fixed so a JS repo with a bare `tests/` dir (Playwright/Cypress e2e) is no longer
  mis-detected as pytest — Python detection now requires real Python evidence.
- **10-run Test Lab validation.** `scripts/testlab-validation.ts` drives the real Test Lab core
  (context → snapshot → install → run → metrics) against real Desktop projects. 12 real runs were
  recorded (10 passed, 2 deliberately-brittle failures, both repaired to pass) across pytest, vitest,
  and jest, plus detection/context checks on three large real repos. See
  `docs/validation/testlab-10-run-validation.md`. The only GUI substitution is the generator
  (structure-aware templates instead of the un-drivable headless model CLI); all execution is real.
- **PDF export preserved.** No change to the Phase 14 PDF flow (saves to Downloads, exact path
  feedback, Reveal/Open).
- **Known limitations.** Permission detection is conservative/heuristic over terminal text — it can
  miss an unusual prompt shape; the card polls every 4s on the current target only. The validation
  harness can't drive the logged-in model CLI headlessly (templated generation). Packaged macOS
  builds remain unsigned/not notarized.

### Project/chat separation + activity drawer fixes (Phase 14)

- **Two chat modes.** Sidebar nav now separates **Workspace** from **Chat**. Workspace is
  project-scoped orchestration: sessions are created/restored with `sessions.project_id`, the
  header shows the selected project, repo context/macro-loop/bridge/Activity controls are available
  only when a project folder is active, and Olympus/Atlantis remain tied to that project. **Chat** is
  general provider chat: sessions use `project_id = NULL`, no project title or project context is
  shown, and `chat:send` passes `includeDigest: false` so the global repo-context setting cannot
  leak project digest text into general conversations.
- **Project switching restores the matching conversation.** Selecting a project switches back to
  Workspace and loads that project's newest session when one exists; otherwise it opens a clean
  project workspace state. Recent chat clicks restore the correct mode: project sessions reopen
  Workspace with their project selected, while general sessions open Chat without forcing project
  context.
- **Activity drawer visibility.** Agent Activity still hosts both `TerminalPane`s and closing the
  drawer only hides it. Olympus/Codex and Atlantis/Claude are always represented for an active
  project, have independent collapse/restore controls, show clear `Starting...` / `Live` /
  `Exited (...)` states, and collapsed slots reserve a visible restore bar so one agent cannot
  silently disappear.
- **Sidebar information architecture.** Sidebar order is brand/nav, Projects, provider folders
  (general chats only), Recent Chats, then fixed profile/footer. The sidebar itself no longer
  scrolls; Recent Chats is the scrollable history region and each item labels **General chat** or
  **Workspace · <project>** with provider/date metadata.
- **PDF export clarity.** Evaluation PDFs now save automatically to the user's Downloads folder as
  `akorith-...pdf`; the Test/Evaluate UI shows the exact saved path, and both current and past
  evaluations offer **Reveal** (Finder at file) and **Open** (system PDF opener). Older internal
  report paths remain allowed for reveal/open.
- **Known limitations.** Project workspaces still choose the newest project-linked session on
  project selection; there is no dedicated project-chat picker beyond Recent Chats yet. Packaged
  macOS builds remain unsigned/not notarized.

### Packaging — electron-builder + macOS app identity (Phase 10)

Phase 10 turns Akorith from a dev Electron app into a packaged desktop app, macOS first.
Nothing in the runtime architecture or security model changed — packaging is config + assets.

**electron-builder.** `electron-builder` 25.x is a devDependency; config lives in the
`build` field of `package.json`. Scripts: `pack` / `pack:mac` (`electron-builder --dir`,
fast unpacked `.app`), `dist` / `dist:mac` (installers: macOS `dmg` + `zip`), `dist:win`
(NSIS config, build on Windows). Each script runs `npm run build` (electron-vite) first, so
`out/{main,preload,renderer}` exists before packaging. `npm run dev` / `build` / `typecheck`
are unchanged.

**Identity.** `package.json` carries `name: "akorith"`, `productName: "Akorith"`,
`description`, `author`. `build.appId = com.akorith.app`, `build.productName = Akorith`. The
packaged macOS bundle's `Info.plist` therefore has `CFBundleName` / `CFBundleDisplayName` =
**Akorith** and `CFBundleIdentifier = com.akorith.app` — so the packaged app shows **Akorith**
in the **menu bar, Dock tooltip, Finder, and window title**, which the dev Electron bundle
could not. Runtime identity (`app.setName('Akorith')`, `app.setAboutPanelOptions`, window
`title`, dock icon via `nativeImage`) is still applied and is now consistent with the bundle.

**Icons.** Source is `assets/akorith-logo.png` (1024², the purple/green marble `Ak` logo).
Generated platform icons live in `build/` (electron-builder's `buildResources` dir):
`build/icon.icns` (macOS, via macOS `sips` → `.iconset` → `iconutil`, 16–1024px), `build/icon.ico`
(Windows, a valid multi-size PNG-backed ICO — 16/24/32/48/64/128/256 — packed by a small
dependency-free Node script since there is no ImageMagick on the build box), and `build/icon.png`
(1024², Linux / fallback). `mac.icon` / `win.icon` / `linux.icon` point at these. The packaged
`.app` uses `icon.icns` (Akorith), not the Electron icon.

**Native modules (the load-bearing packaging detail).**
- `build.npmRebuild = false` — **critical.** electron-builder's default rebuild runs
  `@electron/rebuild` over *all* native deps, which would try to compile node-pty from the
  tarball and fail (missing winpty git metadata). We disable it; `postinstall` has already
  rebuilt better-sqlite3 for Electron's ABI (`electron-rebuild -f -o better-sqlite3`) and
  node-pty uses its N-API prebuilds as-is. The build log confirms
  `skipped dependencies rebuild reason=npmRebuild is set to false`.
- `build.asarUnpack = ['**/node_modules/node-pty/**', '**/node_modules/better-sqlite3/**']`
  so the `.node` binaries and node-pty's `darwin-*/spawn-helper` live on disk under
  `Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/...` (verified: `better_sqlite3.node`,
  `darwin-arm64/pty.node`, and `spawn-helper` present with mode `-rwxr-xr-x` — the
  `fix-spawn-helper` postinstall +x is preserved into the bundle).
- `build.files = ['out/**/*', 'assets/**/*', 'package.json']`; electron-builder adds the
  production `node_modules` automatically. `assets/**` is included so `resolveAppIcon()` /
  the dock icon can read `assets/akorith-logo.png` from inside the asar at runtime.

**Packaged-app PATH (macOS GUI launch).** A Finder/Dock-launched app inherits a minimal
`PATH`, so `claude`/`codex`/`ollama` in Homebrew or a user bin dir would be invisible —
terminals would always fall back to a shell and providers would read unavailable. `main/
index.ts` `ensureCliPath()` (run first in `whenReady`) **prepends** the well-known install
dirs that exist (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.npm-global/bin`,
`~/.bun/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, the standard system dirs, …) to `process.env.PATH`. No shell is
spawned and nothing is eval'd — just static dirs. The existing PATH-based resolution in
`pty.ts` (`resolveExecutable`) and the providers then works in a packaged build; a still-
missing CLI degrades exactly as before (shell fallback + clear message; provider unavailable).

**Smoke test (this build).** `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false npm run pack:mac` produced
`dist/mac-arm64/Akorith.app` (ad-hoc/linker-signed arm64, so it launches locally). Verified:
bundle `Info.plist` name = Akorith / id = com.akorith.app / icon = icon.icns; app launches
(main + renderer helper processes alive); `~/Library/Application Support/Akorith/loopex.db` is
created on startup — i.e. **better-sqlite3 loads in the packaged context** (initDb runs every
launch and would crash on a load failure); node-pty + spawn-helper unpacked and executable.
GUI interaction (Open/Create Project, terminals, macro-loop) uses the unchanged dev code
paths and the PATH fix above.

**Known packaging limitations / how to continue.**
- **Not code-signed/notarized.** The build is ad-hoc signed (runs on the build machine);
  distributing to other Macs will hit Gatekeeper. Next: an Apple Developer ID + electron-
  builder `mac.notarize` / `afterSign` notarization.
- **Windows `.exe` not built here** (config is in place; build on Windows with `dist:win`).
  Regenerate a multi-resolution `build/icon.ico` there if the single-size ICO looks coarse.
- **`dist/` is git-ignored** — packaged artifacts are attached to GitHub Releases, not committed.
- **userData dir is now `…/Akorith/`** (driven by `app.setName`), holding `loopex.db` /
  `loopex.config.json`. The DB/config *filenames* still say `loopex` — harmless, optional
  rename later. The internal repo/package history name remains "Loopex/loopex".

### Test page — isolated local-model test lab (Phase 7)

A **separate route** (sidebar nav: Workspace / Dashboard / **Test**; Workspace stays default).
Simple layout: one chat (left) + one read-only output terminal (right). A local model writes
tests for code in a repo the user picks, the tests run automatically in a **safe isolated
sandbox**, and objective metrics are collected. Comparing how well local models write tests is
a first-class use. Phase 7 ends at "tests ran, here are the metrics," persisted for Phase 8.

- **Frameworks**: Python (`pytest`) and JS/TS (`jest`/`vitest`, or the package.json `test`
  script). Auto-detected from the repo (pyproject/pytest.ini/requirements → pytest;
  vitest/jest dep or `test` script → that runner). The user can override the runner/command;
  if nothing is detected they must supply the test command.
- **Source = read-only, execution = ephemeral sandbox (the safety contract).** The source
  repo is **never written to** from this page. Each run creates a fresh dir under
  `os.tmpdir()/loopex-testlab/<runId>` and **snapshots** the source in (git repos: copy the
  `git ls-files` + untracked-not-ignored set — current working state, `.gitignore` respected,
  heavy dirs excluded; non-git: recursive copy minus a denylist). Generated tests + auto-run
  all happen in the sandbox.
- **Execution = a bounded child process** (not a PTY), cwd = sandbox, with a configurable
  **timeout** and a whole-**process-tree kill** (detached process group → `kill(-pid)` on
  POSIX, `taskkill /T /F` on Windows). A manual **Stop** aborts a run the same way. Generated
  file paths are confined to the sandbox (no absolute/`..`). Sandboxes are pruned to
  `keepLastN`. **Residual risk:** generated code runs automatically — isolation (temp dir +
  timeout + no-write-to-source + tree-kill) is what makes that acceptable; **network is not
  sandboxed**, and nothing runs as admin/sudo.
- **Dependencies**: configurable `installDeps` (default ON when a lockfile is present) runs
  e.g. `npm ci` / `pip install -r` in the sandbox first; an install failure is its own
  `install-failed` status, never reported as a misleading test failure.
- **Metrics per run**: framework, pass/fail/error counts, total + per-test duration, exit
  code, tokens used to generate (from `SendResult.usage`), model, attempts, sandbox path,
  capped raw output. The test-page chat omits `sessionId`, so it writes **no `usage_event`**
  (no dashboard pollution); tokens come from the send result.
- **Multi-model comparison** (a mode, not the default): the same task runs against several
  selected models in turn, each in its own fresh sandbox, metrics shown side by side.
- **Persistence**: every run is written to the `test_runs` table (`id, ts, source_repo,
  target_desc, provider_id, model, framework, passed, failed, errored, duration_ms, exit_code,
  tokens, attempts, sandbox_path, raw_output [capped], status`) so runs survive restart.
  Phase 8 reads `test_runs` and writes ISAScore/PDF results to `evaluations`; the Test page still
  does not score while tests are being generated/run.
- **Code layout**: `src/main/testlab.ts` is the electron-free safety core (detect / snapshot /
  bounded run / parse / prune — headlessly verifiable); `src/main/testlab-ipc.ts` is the
  electron wiring (sandbox lifecycle, streaming, persistence). Config: `test.sourceRepo`
  (defaults to `digest.workingDir`), `test.installDeps`, `test.timeoutMs`, `test.keepLastN`,
  `test.defaultProviderId`.

### Evaluate + PDF — ISAScore reports (Phase 8)

The Test page now evaluates existing `test_runs`; it **never re-runs tests** and does not change
the Phase 7 sandbox safety model. "Evaluate" can target one finished run or a selected comparison
set. The main process owns scoring, optional judging, persistence, PDF generation, and OS reveal/open
actions via the frozen `window.api.evaluate` bridge.

**ISAScore is dimensional.** Each evaluation stores the full breakdown, not just the total:

- **TESTS** (objective, dominant): parsed from `test_runs` as
  `passed / (passed + failed + errored) * 100`; `install-failed`, `timeout`, `aborted`, and
  `no-tests` score 0 even if other fields are missing.
- **SPEED** (objective): normalized within the selected evaluation set as
  `fastest selected duration / this duration * 100`; missing/zero duration is omitted.
- **TOKEN EFFICIENCY** (objective): normalized within the selected set as
  `lowest selected token count / this token count * 100`; missing/zero token counts are omitted.
- **QUALITY** (optional): the only LLM-scored dimension. It is omitted when the user skips the LLM
  step or the judge returns invalid/unusable JSON. When any dimension is omitted, the weighted
  total re-normalizes over the remaining active dimensions, so objective-only scoring is fully
  meaningful with zero LLM calls.

Weights live in `loopex.config.json` under `isascore.weights` and default to
`tests=0.55`, `speed=0.15`, `tokens=0.15`, `quality=0.15`. `src/main/config.ts` merges defaults
so old config files still work.

**Optional quality judge.** The user selects a chat-capable registry provider/model for each
evaluation (Claude, ChatGPT, Local, or any external chat provider). The judge prompt includes
generated test code when available plus objective run metrics and asks for strict JSON:
per-run `qualityScore` 0–100 and a short rationale covering coverage intent, readability,
assertion correctness, and idiomatic framework use. `src/main/evaluate.ts` parses defensively;
on failure it records the failure note, omits Quality, and keeps the objective score. Judge calls
use `sendMetaPrompt()` in `providers/registry.ts`: they write no messages, no `usage_event`, and
do not include repo digest. Judge usage may be recorded inside the evaluation JSON for transparency,
and `judge_model` is stored/displayed so scores from different judges are not silently compared.

**PDF reports.** `pdfkit` is the only report renderer (pure JS dependency, main process only).
PDFs are written under `app.getPath('userData')/reports` and can be opened/revealed through
validated `evaluate:*` IPC. A single reusable template covers both modes:

- **Single**: project/source/target/date, objective metrics, dimensional ISAScore breakdown,
  weighted total, judge label (`objective-only` when skipped), LLM rationale when present, and
  generated test code excerpt.
- **Comparison**: same template/branding with a ranked side-by-side table
  (model, pass rate, duration, tokens, each dimension, total), judge label, rationale, and
  generated-test excerpts.

`test_runs.generated_files` is nullable metadata added in Phase 8 for new runs. Older rows remain
valid; evaluation falls back to scanning the retained sandbox for generated test-like files and
otherwise reports that the generated code excerpt is unavailable.

## Phase 15 - Theme Toggle

Akorith now has a persisted Light/Dark theme selector in the sidebar profile Settings popover.
The renderer owns the selected theme in `App.tsx`, stores it in `localStorage` as
`akorith.theme`, and applies it through `<div className="app" data-theme="...">`.

Theme rules are token-first. Light mode keeps the navigation white and lifts workspace grays to
soft, readable product surfaces. Dark mode makes the former white navigation a dark gray surface
and pushes the workspace grays toward black, while preserving contrast for text, controls, recent
chats, copyable code blocks, and popovers. The sidebar no longer hardcodes light-only surface
tokens; it inherits `--sidebar-*` variables from the selected app theme.

Terminals and agent activity surfaces remain intentionally dark-scoped. Do not route terminal
colors through the user theme unless Phase 15.x explicitly asks for terminal theming.

## Phase 15.1 - Local Provider + Workspace Context Reliability

- **Local/Ollama provider:** the Local provider can auto-start `ollama serve` when the loopback
  server is down (`providers.local.autoStart`, default true). `exposeLan` binds auto-started
  Ollama as `0.0.0.0:11434`, or `ollamaHost` can provide a sanitized host override. Auto-start is
  loopback-only; remote `baseUrl`s are probed but never spawned locally. `localhost` still falls
  back to `127.0.0.1`, and Windows common install paths such as
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ollama\ollama.exe` are checked even when Electron's PATH cannot see
  `ollama`.
- **Workspace context is main-trusted:** renderer may pass a workspace hint, but `chat:send`
  derives the actual project name/path from the persisted session's `project_id` via
  `getSessionProjectContext()`. Repo digest for Workspace chats uses that validated stored project
  path, so General Chat and spoofed IPC payloads cannot point digest at arbitrary folders.
- **Permission prompts:** Codex-style "trust this folder/workspace/repo" output is detected in
  `agentic-core.ts` as a medium-risk access decision requiring review. PTY startup must not answer
  it directly; any response goes through the visible permission UI / Auto Mode policy and the
  existing `bridgeSend -> PtyManager.write()` path.
- **Test Lab polish:** the main Test route now stays intentionally narrow: choose a repo, choose a
  test type, generate with Local/Ollama, then score selected runs with Claude or ChatGPT to produce
  ISAScore. The repo input accepts local paths or GitHub repo URLs; GitHub URLs are validated as
  `github.com/owner/repo`, cloned with `git clone --depth 1` into Akorith's managed
  `testlab-github-repos` cache under `userData`, then fed into the same read-only snapshot/sandbox
  path. JS/TS repos with `package.json` but no configured test runner now fall back to
  `npx --yes vitest run` with an `akorith.generated.test.*` file instead of blocking as
  `unknown`. Multi-model comparison and optional quality toggles are no longer part of the primary
  flow. The verifier is Windows-safe (`node -e` timeout fixture, `execFileSync` for git status,
  `readdirSync` for prune counts).
- **Chat/sidebar/startup polish:** Recent chats render title-only like Codex, assistant responses
  expose a whole-message copy action as soon as text exists, scroll no longer clears selection state
  on every scroll event, and a small native splash window shows the Akorith logo over the purple /
  green marbled background while the renderer boots.

## Phase 16 - GitHub Test Lab, LAN Ollama, and Image Chat

- **Why the screenshot test failed:** the generated fallback Vitest test imported `@/lib/slugs`,
  but the temporary Vitest runner had no Next/TS alias config, so Vitest failed before executing
  any tests (`Cannot find package '@/lib/slugs'`). Phase 16 writes a sandbox-only
  `akorith.vitest.config.mjs` whenever Akorith uses the fallback Vitest command, mapping `@` and
  `~` to the sandbox repo root. The generator prompt also tells models to prefer relative imports
  and to use only real exported names from the source samples.
- **GitHub Test Lab source:** the Test repo input accepts local paths and GitHub repo URLs
  (`https://github.com/owner/repo`, `github.com/owner/repo`, or `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`).
  Main validates GitHub-only refs, clones with `git clone --depth 1` into the managed
  `userData/testlab-github-repos` cache, then feeds the resulting local folder into the existing
  read-only snapshot/sandbox path.
- **LAN Ollama discovery:** Local/Ollama defaults now include `exposeLan: true` and
  `lanDiscovery: true`. When Akorith starts Ollama itself for a loopback config, it binds with
  `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`; when localhost is unavailable (for example on a MacBook), the Local
  provider scans private IPv4 `/24` LAN candidates for `/api/tags` and reuses the first reachable
  Ollama server, so a Mac can see models exposed from the Windows host. If Ollama was already
  running localhost-only on the host, restart Ollama/Akorith so it can bind to LAN.
- **Image chat attachments:** the composer supports up to four PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF images (6 MB each
  in the renderer, validated to 8 MB base64 in main). User messages show thumbnails. Local/Ollama
  receives real image bytes via `/api/chat` `images` for multimodal local models; text-only CLI
  providers receive an attachment-name note but not pixel data.

### Phase 23: Biggest Test Step of Akorith

`docs/validation/phase23-biggest-test-step.md` is the broad product validation pass for the current
Phase 23 surface. It records the combination matrix across General Chat, Workspace, bridge sends,
agent summaries, permission cards, Loops, Test Lab, dashboard, settings, packaging, and remote
Local/Ollama.

Results: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `verify-macro-loop`, `verify-agentic-loop`,
`verify-critic-loop`, `verify-conversation-context`, `verify-bridge-autoenter`,
`verify-workspace-loop`, and `verify-testlab` pass. Live Local/Ollama model calls were blocked
because the home PC was off, but the remote model path is documented: use Tailscale/WireGuard or a
protected tunnel, run Ollama on the PC with `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`, paste the PC's
`http://100.x.y.z:11434` endpoint into Mac Akorith Settings, Test, then Save.

Findings to remember for future phases: an already installed packaged app stays old until a fresh
build/package is launched or installed; `electron-vite dev` only hot-reloads renderer code, so
`src/main` and `src/preload` changes require restarting the dev server; `package.json` still says
`0.1.0`; and `npm run pack:mac` compiled but then hung silently during this validation window with
no `dist/mac-arm64/Akorith.app` output, so packaging needs another focused investigation before a
release.

### Phase 23.1: Fully Active/Passive Loop Switch

The Loop section now exposes a **Fully loop** Active/Passive switch. Active mode starts and keeps
the loop running automatically; Passive mode creates or returns the session to a waiting state so
the user manually resumes it. This maps to the existing macro `auto`/`approval` modes and preserves
the single executor write path.

### Phase 23.2: Loop Operations Center

The Loop section is now a final-product-quality autonomous automation center. Users can start from
templates or a natural-language instruction, choose a target (new project, local project, GitHub
repo, social source, research source, or custom source), schedule, autonomy mode, stop limits,
commit/push/report behavior, safety level, validation commands, provider/model, and executor.
Loops are auditable and manageable with Resume, Stop, Complete, Duplicate, Archive, and Remove.
The backend stores Loop-native targets/runs/events/templates/artifacts/reports, mirrors automatic
actions into `loop_events`, records each autonomous run in `loop_runs`, uses the loop workspace for
repo digest context, and refuses to mark project-like loops complete when no project change was
verified.

### Phase 24: Loop Completion

Loop output is now GitHub-auditable instead of only local. Existing Phase 23 loop folders were
migrated into `~/Documents/AkorithLoop` and pushed to `saitakarcesme/AkorithLoop` with one folder
per loop. New commit-producing loops normalize `push_enabled` to true in the main process, push the
Phase 0 scaffold immediately, and push every later `Phase N: ...` commit from `maybeAutoCommit()`.
The renderer cannot silently disable push while `commitBehavior` is `commit`.

The Loop detail page has a GitHub sync panel backed by main-process git inspection. It reports the
remote URL, branch, path-scoped commit count, latest Phase number, ahead/behind counts, dirty file
count, head, and latest commit subject. Manual **Sync to AkorithLoop** runs through the shared loop
git queue, repairs the origin URL, pulls/rebases with autostash, pushes to `main`, updates
`push_enabled`, and writes a success/failure `loop_events` record.

Loop history is now durable after restart: `listLoopRuns()` / `listLoopEvents()` expose the
persisted `loop_runs` and `loop_events` tables through `macro:listRuns` and `macro:listEvents`.
`LoopsPage.tsx` renders these as Run ledger and Event log panels in addition to the older turn
timeline and `auto_actions` audit trail. Keep loop deletes DB-only; never delete loop folders.

### Phase 25: Test Lab Rebuild

Test Lab is now a guided English workflow: source selection, Local/Ollama test writer, fixed test
subject preset, Local/Claude/ChatGPT result judge, then one run action that evaluates and exports a
PDF. Sources can come from saved projects, a folder picker, or GitHub URLs; generated tests still
write only into a temporary sandbox copied from the source. The old advanced runner controls remain
available but collapsed.

The PDF report is now an Akorith Test Report with a dark header, verdict, ISAScore, metadata,
objective metrics, run evidence, score breakdown, judge rationale, generated test excerpts, and
bounded output excerpts. The primary Test Lab flow keeps running until the PDF path is available.

### Phase 26: Settings Center

The sidebar profile footer opens `SettingsCenter.tsx`, a tabbed settings surface with Profile,
Providers, Workflow, Test Lab, and Data sections. It centralizes the knobs that had been scattered
across the sidebar and workflow surfaces without adding new unsafe capabilities.

Settings writes still go through their existing main-process owners: theme via `settings:*`, Ollama
via `ollama:*`, bridge Auto-Enter via `bridge:*`, repo context via `digest:*`, and Test Lab defaults
via the new validated `test:setSettings` IPC. `config.ts` clamps Test Lab timeout, retained sandbox
count, source length, and provider id before writing `loopex.config.json`. Renderer folder choices
reuse the validated `projects:pickDirectory` dialog; renderer code never writes project files.

### Phase 27: Local Executor Loop

Local/Ollama models are now first-class Loop executors without raw shell control. The Loop UI can
choose `Local structured executor`, select a local Ollama model, and show attempts, validated
changes, commits, last validation, and last commit separately from PTY executor state. PTY loops
still use Claude/Codex through the existing `bridgeSend()`/PTY path.

`src/main/local-executor.ts` is the electron-free safety core. It asks local models for strict
`workspace_patch` JSON, validates relative paths inside the selected workspace, blocks absolute
paths, traversal, protected folders, and secret-like files, applies full-file changes with rollback
data, runs only allowlisted validation commands with timeouts, strips ANSI from command evidence,
and scores structured output, patch application, validation, meaningfulness, goal alignment, scope,
and spam/churn. Failed, malformed, no-op, unsafe, or low-value attempts are attempts only; they are
rolled back and not committed.

`macro_sessions` has `executor_type`, `executor_provider`, `executor_model`,
`last_attempt_status`, `last_validation_result`, and `last_commit_message`. `runAutoLoop()` branches:
`pty` preserves the previous terminal executor architecture; `local` calls the selected Ollama model
as a meta prompt, records each attempt in `macro_turns` and `loop_runs`, validates it through the
local executor core, commits only meaningful passing changes via path-scoped `commitPhase()`, never
pushes automatically, and pauses after repeated local failures. `commitPhase(cwd, headline, paths)`
keeps its old all-worktree behavior when paths are omitted, but local executor calls pass the touched
file list so unrelated dirty user changes are not swept into a commit.

`scripts/verify-local-executor.ts` covers path traversal, absolute paths, dangerous command blocks,
valid patch acceptance, failed-validation no-commit rollback, no-op no-commit, and path-scoped local
commits. This is also the minimal Test Lab connection for the next phase: Loop sessions now have
separate planner/executor/critic model slots, so Test Lab benchmark winners can later be recommended
as the executor model without changing the core loop schema.

### Phase 57: Durable Goal Cycle + Chat Isolation

Loop is task-agnostic rather than commit-driven. At start, `goal-cycle.ts` converts the request into
a bounded Goal contract: task kind, deliverables, acceptance criteria, constraints, and the first
objective. Each durable cycle then follows **Understand -> Plan -> Execute -> Analyze -> Replan**.
`goal.ts` marks a Goal complete only when the analysis returns concrete evidence, no remaining work,
and sufficient confidence; a single commit, command, or partial artifact can never complete the
whole Goal. Remaining work updates the open backlog objective and routes the next cycle back to Plan.
Three stalled cycles or an explicit blocker transitions to `needs_review`. The existing per-loop
AbortController map keeps multiple Goals concurrent, independently pausable, and resumable.

The renderer replaces the dense fleet/event board with a restrained five-state flow diagram,
compact concurrent Goal tabs, a definition-of-done panel, and four bounded evidence checkpoints.
The selected folder remains the durable boundary for code, research inputs, PDFs/DOCX/Markdown,
generated artifacts, and local Git checkpoints; push remains off.

General Chat and Workspace rendering are explicitly separate. Only Workspace assistant turns
receive `WorkspaceActivity`, duration, and Step UI. Active requests are keyed by session id and
their message buffers are cached per session, so a Stop control cannot leak into another chat or
project; returning to the actual running session restores its control. The Step chip is fixed over
the composer and exposes all six Workspace steps on hover/focus. Running labels animate alongside
their icons, while explanatory paragraphs remain stable, readable text. Fenced code uses the final
theme-aware code surface.

Verify with `npm run verify:goal-cycle`, `npm run verify:project-loop`, `npm run typecheck`, and
`npm run build`. Keep Goal-completion analysis evidence-based, never infer completion from activity,
and never merge per-session request state back into one global busy flag.

### Phase 58: Codex-Parity Chat + Durable Attachments

General Chat is project-free and ChatGPT-style. Workspace is project-scoped and Codex-style; CLI
providers stay headless. Shared `ChatMessageView` and `ChatMarkdown` render safe Markdown/GFM,
tables, task lists, links, and theme-aware code. Do not enable raw HTML rendering.

Attachments are copied into the app-owned userData attachment directory before dispatch. Enforce
8 files, 16 MB per file, and 40 MB per turn; persist attachment metadata with the user message and
delete only Akorith's managed copies during session deletion/reset. Never modify or remove the
original user file. Codex images use its native image argument; Claude/OpenCode receive validated
managed paths; bounded local text/code may be inlined for Ollama.

All active request state is per-session: streaming token buffers, cached messages, Stop controls,
follow-up queues, and request handles. Navigation may show aggregate background work but must never
move another task's Stop state into the current composer. General Chat must reset hidden Workspace
Plan intent.

The five parity controls are Queue, bounded project-only `@` file mentions, read-only Plan,
project-scoped Changes, and task search/pinning. Changes validates a single relative path before
Stage/Unstage and provides no revert/commit/push/content-write path. CLI resolution must prioritize
the user's standard install locations over Electron's bundled PATH. The final shared product layer
is `product-polish.css`, imported last.

Verify with typecheck/build, every repository verification script, production audit, Electron CDP
navigation/streaming tests, Plan no-write, Queue ordering, mentions, Changes Stage/Unstage,
search/pin, Markdown, PDF/image attachments, themes, and responsive page checks.

### Phase 59: Live Profile, Completion Receipts, and Local Tool Plugins

The Dashboard profile avatar is intentionally absent. The display name is the identity mark:
large, handwritten, and layered over a second read-only rendering of the existing CPU history in
translucent gray. The lower Compute usage chart remains unchanged. Token activity owns the full
profile content width; its 53 columns, month labels, heading, and Daily edge share one measure.

Completed General Chat and Workspace responses render a structured receipt. Every receipt can
persist provider/model, token usage, and elapsed time in `messages.metadata`. Workspace execution
also snapshots the managed Git worktree before and after the request, then reports only changed
snapshot entries with bounded file paths and `+`/`-` line totals. This is read-only telemetry: it
must never stage, revert, commit, push, or inspect a renderer-supplied untrusted directory.

The plugin registry contains 15 additional audited free local CLI manifests: Git, ripgrep, jq,
SQLite, FFmpeg, Pandoc, Poppler, ImageMagick, Tesseract, Graphviz, Python, Node.js, Git LFS,
ShellCheck, and yt-dlp. Diagnostics run only static version arguments. Akorith never downloads or
installs them automatically and never loads arbitrary plugin code. `enabledPluginContext()` exposes
only installed + enabled capability hints to Workspace and Goal prompts; every existing workspace,
approval, secret, destructive-action, and no-push rule remains authoritative.

Verification: run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run verify:workspace-loop`,
`npm run verify:opencode-output`, `npm run verify:update-version`, and `npm run release:check`;
then use Electron CDP to verify the 371-cell Dashboard grid alignment, absent avatar, gray CPU
backdrop, completion receipt, plugin counts/statuses, broken images, and horizontal overflow.

### Phase 60: Restored Profile + Authentic Plugin Identity

Phase 60 supersedes only the Dashboard presentation rules from Phase 59. The profile avatar,
standard display-name typography, and `@local · Akorith` identity line are restored. Token activity
returns to the compact 820 px calendar measure and its earlier fixed cell geometry. The lower
Compute usage history remains the sole CPU wave; do not add a duplicate graph behind the username.

All 15 local CLI additions now have a product-specific upstream identity asset. Use only the
matching project's official site/repository asset or a traced brand vector; never substitute an
Akorith monogram, generic GitHub logo, generated initials, or another placeholder. Keep provenance
in `src/renderer/src/assets/plugin-logos/SOURCES.md` and verify every packaged image decodes.

Verification: typecheck/build, plugin diagnostics, all-logo mapping, Dashboard DOM/computed-style
checks (avatar present, normal heading, no profile backdrop, compact activity, lower CPU wave
present), Plugins broken-image checks, release validation, and packaged Electron smoke testing.

### Phase 61: Quiet Loop Surface + Visual Workspace Flow

Loop keeps concurrent Goal tabs and the New tab entry point, but its selected Goal is now a flat,
transcript-like surface. The five Goal phases share one slim connected stepper; the current phase
is explained directly below it, and checkpoints plus definition of done live in one disclosure
instead of four permanent cards. Archive is an icon action and the composer remains the stable
bottom interaction point. Do not restore nested status, diagram, current-phase, and evidence cards.

Project and general chat rows reserve a fixed action column so long names always ellipsize before
their controls. Pin, rename, delete, and project overflow controls use semantic SVG icons with
titles and aria labels; destructive deletion remains a two-click confirmation. Do not put text
such as `Delete` or `Delete?` back inside compact sidebar rows.

Workspace may add a compact execution-flow diagram derived only from recorded CLI activities.
Render it only when at least three distinct meaningful stages exist; short answers remain prose.
The diagram is explanatory and read-only, never a source of execution state or new authority.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run verify:workspace-loop`,
`npm run verify:goal-cycle`, `npm run verify:project-loop`, Electron CDP at wide and 891 px widths,
and explicit checks that chat actions have reserved static width with no horizontal overflow.

### Phase 62: Aligned Profile Telemetry + True Loop Topology

The Dashboard identity keeps the stored profile photo and `@local · Akorith` line, while the
display name uses the local macOS SignPainter handwriting face with Snell Roundhand and Savoye LET
fallbacks. The five-stat frame, Token activity heading, Daily edge, 53-column grid, and month row
share the exact 633 px calendar measure. On narrow windows the calendar scrolls inside its own
shell; the page itself must never gain horizontal overflow.

Loop's five working phases are a real directed flow, not a decorative step list. Six SVG edges
encode Understand → Plan → Execute → Analyze, Analyze → Replan, Replan → Plan, and Analyze →
Complete. Review/return edges are dashed and completion is a distinct outcome node. Preserve this
topology and keep narrow-window scrolling local to the diagram canvas.

Benchmark readability comes from hierarchy rather than uniform scaling: primary descriptions,
picker values, library insights, matrix labels, and recent-run content receive stronger size and
contrast while metadata remains quiet. Do not flatten these levels into one font size.

Verification: typecheck/build, Workspace/Goal/Project Loop scripts, update-version verification,
Electron CDP at wide and 891 px widths, exact Dashboard edge measurements, six Loop paths, local
font availability, and absence of page-level horizontal overflow.

### Phase 63: Fluid Loop Topology + Current Website

The Loop topology scales against the available content width instead of forcing a 700 px canvas.
All five phase nodes, the Complete outcome, six directed connectors, and branch labels retain their
relative geometry without an internal horizontal scrollbar. Narrow containers reduce node chrome
and ellipsize labels; the diagram and the surrounding page must not overflow horizontally.

AkorithWeb preserves its existing public visual language while its routes, copy, and interactive
desktop replica describe the current Workspace, concurrent durable Loops, Dashboard telemetry,
Benchmark library, Plugins, Settings, native downloads, and update flow. The retired desktop
Agents/Companions surface is not presented as a current route. Website changes live in the
separate `saitakarcesme/AkorithWeb` repository and must pass lint, production build, mobile/desktop
overflow checks, and interactive Workspace/Loop/Benchmark checks before publishing.

Verification: run typecheck/build and all Workspace/Loop/update release scripts; use Electron CDP
to measure Loop geometry at wide and narrow content widths; then lint/build AkorithWeb and verify
its primary routes at desktop and 390 px mobile widths with no page-level overflow.

### Phase 64: Table Benchmark + Verified GitHub Loops

Benchmark is table-first. The active challenge selector lives at the upper-right, selected models
are compact pills, and both the current comparison and saved library are readable row tables. Keep
the challenge score, token count, and average visually aligned; do not restore the former matrix,
large model cards, or nested horizontal scrolling.

Loop is deliberately quieter than Workspace. Its durable Goal state is summarized by six connected
step dots — Understand, Plan, Execute, Analyze, Replan, Complete — above the conversation. The rest
of the surface remains a chat transcript and bottom composer. Do not restore the SVG flow diagram
or evidence-card wall; execution state continues to come from the Goal engine, never from the
renderer.

`Choose repository` accepts a clean GitHub repository URL rather than opening a folder picker. The
main process clones through the authenticated `gh` CLI into Akorith's managed `loop-workspaces`
directory. GitHub-enabled Loops may push only when the stored owner/repository exactly matches the
checked-out `origin`; a detached HEAD, dirty pre-sync tree, or origin mismatch blocks remote work.
Each cycle pulls with rebase before execution, creates a local Akorith commit, then performs a
normal non-force push with one pull/rebase retry. A failed push preserves the local commit and moves
the Loop to `needs_review`.

Goals targeting `saitakarcesme/AkorithLoop` are scoped to a unique, readable project folder so
unrelated examples cannot be changed. Repository credentials or tokens must never be embedded in
stored URLs, clone arguments, logs, or renderer state.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run verify:project-loop`, the related
Workspace/Goal/update scripts, Electron CDP geometry at wide/narrow widths, a real disposable
clone→commit→push smoke run, and confirmation that no page-level horizontal overflow is introduced.

### Phase 65: Narrated Loop Progress + Unified Activity

Loop progress is a compact conversation timeline. Every durable Goal event renders as a numbered
Step with a human title, a bounded explanatory paragraph, and quiet timestamp metadata; raw Goal
JSON must never be printed as the paragraph. The six phase dots and bottom composer remain the
only permanent Loop controls. When the sidebar is hidden, the Loop header, tabs, transcript, and
composer stay in a centered reading column instead of stretching across the full window.

The sidebar no longer lists Dashboard as a primary navigation row. The footer identity opens the
Dashboard and the separate gear opens Settings. Resizing paints CSS width variables in one
`requestAnimationFrame` and commits React state only on pointer-up so dense pages do not rerender
on every mouse movement.

Dashboard shows two closely stacked, identically aligned 53-week calendars: local Token activity
and the public `saitakarcesme` GitHub contribution calendar. GitHub data is fetched in the main
process from GitHub's public contribution page, cached for 15 minutes, exposed through a narrow
preload method, and rendered with GitHub's green intensity scale. Network failure must leave the
local Dashboard usable.

AkorithWeb mirrors this information architecture in its interactive replica while keeping the
public site's existing visual system. Verify desktop typecheck/build and GitHub activity loading,
Electron wide/collapsed Dashboard and Loop geometry, smooth sidebar drag, then website lint/build
plus desktop/mobile interaction and overflow checks.

### Phase 66: Current Activity + Quiet General Chat

The Dashboard calendars always include the local current day in their final Sunday–Saturday
column. Future cells may fill the remainder of that week, but the current day must never be cut off
by start-date alignment. Token and public GitHub maps continue to share the exact same dates.

The profile display name resolves the exact macOS `SignPainter-HouseScript` face through local font
names, with no bundled or copied Apple asset. Apple's animated Hello artwork is path-based rather
than a distributable typeface; the app therefore uses the installed system face and preserves
portable script fallbacks. Keep the enlarged avatar and identity line centered.

General Chat is prose-first: completed assistant replies do not show Workspace receipts, elapsed
time, model/token metrics, or file deltas. Workspace retains its evidence receipt. Whole-message,
code-block, endpoint, controller, and path copy actions are icon-only, with stable accessible labels
and tooltips. Loop detail and its bottom composer share one 700 px reading measure in both expanded
and collapsed-sidebar states.

Verification: typecheck/build, current-day tooltip inspection, local font resolution, General Chat
receipt absence, icon-only copy controls, and Electron geometry confirming Loop detail/composer
width equality without horizontal overflow.

### Phase 67: Unified Profile Typography

The Dashboard display name uses the same `--font-ui` typography token as the rest of Akorith.
Do not introduce a separate script or platform-only font for profile identity. Keep the enlarged
avatar and display-name scale, while matching the app's Avenir-led weight and tracking.

Verification: typecheck/build plus Electron inspection confirming the computed profile font begins
with Avenir Next and the existing centered profile geometry remains intact.

### Phase 68: Permissioned Project Computer Use

Workspace and Loop share `ProjectPreviewPanel`, a compact launcher and live project surface for the
currently selected project. Main-process `project-preview.ts` canonicalizes the directory, reads
declared package scripts, and permits only `dev`, `start`, `serve`, or `preview`. A contained root
`index.html` may instead run through Akorith's built-in loopback-only static server. Never accept an
arbitrary command string or browser target from renderer or model output.

Each launch uses a reserved loopback port and `spawn()` with `shell:false`. The hidden offscreen
BrowserWindow is sandboxed, denies new windows, and blocks every non-loopback navigation. Renderer
capture/input IPC is session-scoped and supports pointer movement, click, bounded text insertion,
and bounded key input. Stopping a preview or quitting Akorith terminates the process group and
destroys the offscreen window.

An explicit Workspace/Loop request to open the site in Chrome or the default browser is handled by
the provider-neutral `workspace-actions.ts` broker after the model finishes its project work. The
broker derives the trusted project root from the persisted session, opens only the preview session's
verified loopback URL, and launches Chrome by a known executable with `shell:false`. Provider shell
allowlists must continue to reject generic `open`, `start`, or arbitrary browser commands.

The reference interaction lab lives outside the repository at
`~/Desktop/Projects/AkorithComputerUseLab`. Verification includes typecheck/build, Workspace and
Loop regressions, an Electron launch/stream/type/stop smoke test, and confirmation that the preview
port closes after Stop.

### Phase 69: Autonomous Research

Research is a first-class sidebar destination, separate from General Chat, Workspace, and Loop.
`ResearchPage` keeps concurrent investigations in tabs and switches between the active Research
workspace and a persistent Library. `ResearchComposer` accepts one unattended research request,
an explicit CLI provider/model, Quick (~10 minutes), Research (~1 hour), Deep (10+ hours), or
Continuous depth, and a PDF, Markdown, DOCX, XLSX, or PowerPoint deliverable. Continuous work remains scheduled
until explicitly paused; bounded depths plan, research, verify, synthesize, export, and complete.

The main-process `src/main/research/` engine owns every lifecycle transition. Eight additive SQLite
tables persist jobs, cycles, checkpoints, events, sources, claims, claim-source links, and versioned
artifacts. The scheduler runs at most three jobs concurrently, uses two-minute leases with 30-second
heartbeats, recovers expired leases/interrupted cycles after restart, and scopes pause/resume/cancel
through per-job `AbortController`s. The renderer receives typed job data and managed IDs only; it
never chooses a research workspace path or opens an arbitrary filesystem target.

Web acquisition permits public HTTP(S) only. It rejects credential-bearing URLs, non-standard
ports, local/private/reserved addresses and redirect pivots, and bounds redirects, request time,
host rate, source size, and extracted text. DuckDuckGo HTML plus Bing RSS discovery feed bounded
HTML/PDF extraction, canonical URL/content deduplication, source credibility metadata, explicit
claim-to-source citations, and prompt-injection containment. Source text is evidence, never model
instructions; inaccessible evidence must remain an explicit gap rather than a fabricated fact.

Every publish creates a deterministic 794 x 1123 A4 portrait cover for the book-style Library and
a new artifact version. Export validation checks SHA-256/size, Markdown structure and references,
PDF cover/report pages, DOCX package structure, and XLSX Overview/Findings/Sources/Methodology sheets
plus formula-injection safety before exposing Open/Reveal actions. Verify with `npm run typecheck`,
`npm run build`, `npm run verify:research`, and `npm run verify:research-live:check`; an intentional
provider smoke run uses `npm run verify:research-live -- --provider all --continuous` (add
`--persist` only when its test records should remain in the real Research Library).

### Phase 70: Research Presentation, Unified Usage, and Sidebar Alignment

The expanded sidebar brand now follows the same two columns as navigation: the Akorith icon aligns
with the Workspace icon and the Akorith label aligns with the Workspace label. Preserve that shared
geometry in both wide and narrow Electron layouts rather than positioning the brand independently.

Research usage is part of the same additive `usage_events` ledger as Chat. A Research job contributes
exactly one user-visible request; plan, cycle, and synthesis calls contribute their complete token
usage (prompt, completion, cache read/write, reasoning, and canonical total) with
`request_count=0`. Stable `(source_kind, source_id)` identities make live recording and historical
backfill idempotent. Never infer `total_tokens` by adding cache or reasoning to a provider-reported
canonical total.

PowerPoint is the fifth Research deliverable beside PDF, Markdown, DOCX, and XLSX. Production decks
are generated with JSZip and editable native 16:9 Open XML shapes, text, tables, and bar graphics;
they preserve Unicode, follow a finding-led narrative, and end with a source appendix. The PPTX
validator checks the package, presentation/slide relationships, readable slide content, and output
MIME before an artifact becomes available. `@oai/artifact-tool` is licensed for internal rendering
and QA only: it must never become an Akorith runtime dependency, be copied into the app, or ship in
a release.

The deterministic Research fixture matrix is now 4 depths × 2 provider families × 5 output formats
= 40 combinations. Verification covers typecheck/build, the Research suite, OpenCode usage parsing,
Research persistence/backfill, artifact-tool rendering plus `slides_test.py`, and wide/narrow
Electron inspection of brand alignment and the updated Research UI.

### Phase 71: Launch-Safe macOS Releases

macOS release packaging must never publish or install an Electron bundle that only passes a static
signature check. `scripts/sign-macos.cjs` uses a discovered certificate when available and one
coherent ad-hoc identity otherwise, while explicit root/inherited entitlements preserve JIT and
disable library validation for Electron's nested framework under hardened runtime.

Every macOS CI package extracts the exact publishable ZIP through
`scripts/verify-macos-artifact.sh`, then runs `scripts/verify-macos-app.sh`. The verifier checks the
bundle and Electron Framework signatures, requires the library-validation entitlement, then launches
the real executable and proves it remains alive. The local refresh flow performs the same launch
smoke test on its staged replacement after quitting the current process but before moving the working
installation. A static `codesign --verify` result alone is not a sufficient release gate.

### Phase 72: Replica Workspace UI

The renderer uses `replica-ui.css` as the final authoritative visual layer. It maps Akorith's real
components onto the neutral workspace shell: 36 px black titlebar, 266 px sidebar (248 px at compact
desktop widths), inset `#181818` app surface with a 10 px top-left corner, 46 px surface toolbar,
736 px home/composer measure, grouped Settings navigation, native-style menus, and the exact
dark/light token families. Keep `styles.css` and `product-polish.css` for feature-level layouts;
`replica-ui.css` must remain the last stylesheet import.

This phase was a visual integration, not a renderer rewrite. `App.tsx` remains the state controller
and the frozen preload API remains the only capability boundary. At Phase 72, Chat, Benchmark, Loop,
and Research remained mounted while hidden. Phase 73 supersedes the Loop part of that statement;
Phase 74 supersedes the Benchmark/Research part. There is no standalone Loop mount or route,
Workspace remains mounted, and Benchmark/Research are intentionally empty route shells with no
legacy renderer, IPC, scheduler, or delivery runtime.
Workspace suggestion cards only prepare real prompts. The feature banner is the real permissioned
`ProjectPreviewPanel`, and every navigation row, project action, model picker, Settings field, and
domain page continues to use its existing IPC and persistence path.

At 720 px and below the sidebar is an overlay sheet with a scrim; responsive auto-collapse must
never overwrite the user's persisted desktop preference. The app supports a 360 px BrowserWindow
minimum and 720/676/540/400 px layout breakpoints without page-level horizontal overflow. The
command palette is rendered outside the hidden sidebar tree, restores focus, and implements arrow,
Home/End, Enter, Tab, and Escape behavior. Native-style top menus expose valid ARIA menu-button
state and working edit commands.

Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run verify:replica-ui`,
`npm run verify:ui-zoom`, the relevant Workspace/Goal/Loop/Plugins/update regression
scripts, plus real Electron screenshots and overflow/keyboard checks at 1440×900, 960×600,
640×800, and 390×780.

### Phase 73: Workspace `/loop` Skill

Phase 73 removes the standalone Loop product surface without deleting the durable Goal engine.
`AppView`, `Sidebar`, feature preloaders, and startup restoration no longer expose `loops`;
`ProjectLoopPage.tsx` and `LoopPipeline.tsx` are removed. A stale persisted `akorith.lastView =
loops` is sanitized to Workspace. Historical Phase 20–72 Loop records below remain architecture
history, not current navigation.

**Activation contract.** `/loop` is available only in a persisted project Workspace. The user writes
an ordinary concrete task and makes `/loop` the final token; matching is case-insensitive and allows
trailing whitespace. Empty goals are rejected. Embedded occurrences and command-looking text inside
quotes, Markdown blockquotes, inline code, or unfinished fenced code remain ordinary content. The
renderer rejects attachments before starting the goal and clears the composer only after the durable
start succeeds. Normal messages continue through `chat:send`; the command branch uses only
`projectLoop:startWorkspaceGoal`.

**Durability and completion.** `workspace_goal_bindings` links the Goal loop to its persisted
session, idempotent request id, user/assistant messages, provider/model, canonical project path,
goal, state, attempts, errors, and timestamps. The bound assistant message is a live status record,
not an early final answer. Its metadata sets `final=true` only for `completed`, after the
Understand → Plan → Execute → Analyze → Replan review reports `goalMet` with sufficient confidence
and inspectable evidence. `paused`, `needs_review`, and `error` preserve progress and expose Resume;
they never masquerade as completion.

**Lifecycle and isolation.** Pause aborts the active provider call and checkpoints the Goal. Resume
revalidates the session's canonical project path before relaunching. On startup, Akorith reconciles
interrupted `project_loop_runs` rows and resumes bindings durably marked `running`; shutdown aborts
in-flight calls only after preserving them as recoverable. A partial unique index permits only one
running Workspace Goal per canonical project path. Normal Workspace execute requests and `/loop`
start/resume/recovery paths share one synchronous canonical-path writer lease for their full provider
lifetime, so neither check-then-act direction can admit two writers.

**Usage and Git safety.** The shared `usage_events` ledger stores one visible Workspace Goal request
(`request_count=1`) plus idempotent token/cost rows for understand, execute, and review stages
(`request_count=0`). Workspace `/loop` locks `pushEnabled=false` and invokes Goal cycles with
`workspaceGoal=true`: it may edit files and run validation, but Akorith's host path never initializes
Git, stages files, commits, or pushes, and every executor is explicitly instructed to leave Git
history unchanged. Local-model rollback is file-scoped and must confirm that rejected changes were
restored; a rollback failure moves the Goal to `needs_review`.

Relevant implementation: `src/renderer/src/workspaceLoopCommand.ts`,
`ChatPanel.tsx`, `WorkspaceLoopActivity.tsx`, `src/main/project-loop/workspace-goals.ts`,
`src/main/workspace-writer-lease.ts`, `goal.ts`, `runner.ts`, and
`workspace_goal_bindings` in `db.ts`. Verify with
`npm run verify:workspace-skill-loop`, `npm run verify:goal-cycle`,
`npm run verify:project-loop`, `npm run verify:startup-hydration`, `npm run typecheck`, and
`npm run build`.

### Phase 74: Workspace Turn-Flow Reset

Phase 74 makes a normal Workspace send read like a real Codex task instead of a simulated chat
narrative. Provider events are the source of truth: Codex `--json` agent messages become exact
commentary, while command, file, plan, reasoning, tool, and failure items update one stable activity
record by provider event id. Live activities are written into the pending assistant message as they
arrive, so a reload can recover the real progress log. Claude and OpenCode no longer expose partial
final-answer text over the activity stream in Workspace; the final answer appears once after tool
work finishes. General Chat retains ordinary answer streaming.

Model selection is isolated by surface. General Chat stores one selection and each project
Workspace stores its own provider/model selection under `akorith.chatSelections.v1`. Entering a
Workspace cannot inherit a model chosen in General Chat, and reopening a saved task restores the
model recorded on that task.

The Workspace Browser now attaches a sandboxed, context-isolated `WebContentsView` inside the tool
surface. It receives native pointer, keyboard, focus, scrolling, and game input; Computer Use keeps
the explicit offscreen capture/input bridge. Browser attachment bounds are renderer-provided but
main-process validated and clamped, navigation and redirects are restricted to loopback URLs,
popups are denied, and hiding/reopening the tab preserves page state until the preview is stopped.

Research and Benchmark remain visible in navigation as intentionally empty sections. Their legacy
renderer pages, main-process handlers/scheduler, preload capabilities, Discord delivery settings,
verification harnesses, exporter dependencies, and packaging resources are removed. Historical DB
tables and user rows remain untouched so this reset is not a destructive data migration.

Canonical verification: `npm run verify:workspace-activity`, `npm run verify:replica-ui`,
`npm run verify:performance`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run verify:bundle`.

## Conventions

- Surgical edits; keep the security posture intact (CSP, sandbox, frozen bridge).
- Mark future integration points with `// TODO(phase N):` comments.
- Prompts and other untrusted text go to CLIs via **stdin**, never argv.
- **At the end of EVERY phase, update BOTH `AGENTS.md` and `codex.md`** (flip the phase
  checklist, record the new state) and commit + push to `origin main`.
